  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Ocean acidification as a result of increased
              anthropogenic CO2 emissions is occurring in marine and estuarine
              environments worldwide. The coastal ocean experiences additional
              daily and seasonal fluctuations in pH that can be lower than
              projected end-of-century open ocean pH reductions. In order to
              assess the impact of ocean acidification on marine invertebrates,
              Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were exposed to one of four
              different p CO2 levels for four weeks: 400 $\mu$atm (pH 8.0), 800
              $\mu$atm (pH 7.7), 1000 $\mu$atm (pH 7.6), or 2800 $\mu$atm (pH
              7.3). RESULTS: At the end of the four week exposure period,
              oysters in all four p CO2 environments deposited new shell, but
              growth rate was not different among the treatments. However,
              micromechanical properties of the new shell were compromised by
              elevated p CO2. Elevated p CO2 affected neither whole body fatty
              acid composition, nor glycogen content, nor mortality rate
              associated with acute heat shock. Shotgun proteomics revealed
              that several physiological pathways were significantly affected
              by ocean acidification, including antioxidant response,
              carbohydrate metabolism, and transcription and translation.
              Additionally, the proteomic response to a second stress differed
              with p CO2, with numerous processes significantly affected by
              mechanical stimulation at high versus low p CO2 (all proteomics
              data are available in the ProteomeXchange under the identifier
              PXD000835). CONCLUSIONS: Oyster physiology is significantly
              altered by exposure to elevated p CO2, indicating changes in
              energy resource use. This is especially apparent in the
              assessment of the effects of p CO2 on the proteomic response to a
              second stress. The altered stress response illustrates that ocean
              acidification may impact how oysters respond to other changes in
              their environment. These data contribute to an integrative view
              of the effects of ocean acidification on oysters as well as
              physiological trade-offs during environmental stress.",

  abstract = "Comparisons of proteomic responses of closely related congeners
              and populations have shown which cellular processes are critical
              to adapt to environmental stress. For example, several proteomic
              species comparisons showed that increasing abundances of
              oxidative stress proteins indicate that reactive oxygen species
              (ROS) represent a ubiquitous signal and possible co-stressor of
              warm and cold temperature, acute hyposaline and low pH stress,
              possibly causing a shift from pro-oxidant NADH-producing to
              anti-oxidant NADPH-producing and -consuming metabolic pathways.
              Changes in cytoskeletal and actin-binding proteins in response to
              several stressors, including ROS, suggest that both are important
              structural and functional elements in responding to stress.
              Disruption of protein homeostasis, e.g., increased abundance of
              molecular chaperones, was severe in response to acute heat
              stress, inducing proteolysis, but was also observed in response
              to chronic heat and cold stress and was concentrated to the
              endoplasmic reticulum during hyposaline stress. Small GTPases
              affecting vesicle formation and transport, Ca(2+)-signaling and
              ion transport responded to salinity stress in species- and
              population-specific ways. Aerobic energy metabolism was in
              general down-regulated in response to temperature, hypoxia,
              hyposalinity and low pH stress, but other metabolic pathways were
              activated to respond to increased oxidative stress or to switch
              metabolic fuels. Thus, comparative proteomics is a powerful
              approach to identify functionally adaptive variation. This

               HighCO2 (1,000 $\mu$atm). After 24 h, a greater proportion of
               larvae in the HighCO2 treatment were calcified as compared to
               Ambient. This unexpected observation is attributed to increased

              organisms are expected to be particularly sensitive due to the
              decreasing availability of carbonate ions driven by decreasing pH
              levels. Recently, some studies focused on the early life stages
              of mollusks that are supposedly more sensitive to environmental
              disturbances than adult stages. Although these studies have shown
              decreased growth rates and increased proportions of abnormal
              development under low pH conditions, they did not allow
              attribution to pH induced changes in physiology or changes due to
              a decrease in aragonite saturation state. This study aims to
              assess the impact of several carbonate-system perturbations on
              the growth of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) larvae during
              the first 3 days of development (until shelled D-veliger larvae).
              Seawater with five different chemistries was obtained by
              separately manipulating pH, total alkalinity and aragonite
              saturation state (calcium addition). Results showed that the

              by changes in pH or aragonite saturation state but were highly
              correlated with the availability of carbonate ions. In contrast
              to previous studies, both developmental success into viable
              D-shaped larvae and growth rates were not significantly altered
              as long as carbonate ion concentrations were above aragonite
              saturation levels, but they strongly decreased below saturation
              levels. These results suggest that the mechanisms used by these
              organisms to regulate calcification rates are not efficient

              Therefore, it is important to understand how metamorphosing

              predict how larvae might be affected in a future ocean, we
              examined changes in the proteome of metamorphosing larvae under
              multiple stressors: decreased pH (pH 7.4), increased temperature
              (30 °C), and reduced salinity (15 psu). Quantitative protein
              expression profiling using iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS identified more than

              energy production, metabolism, and protein synthesis. However,
              warming switched on these down-regulated pathways at pH 7.4.

              pH. The consequent decrease in calcium carbonate saturation
              potentially threatens calcareous marine organisms. Here, we
              demonstrate that the calcification rates of the edible mussel
              (Mytilus edulis) and Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) decline
              linearly with increasing pCO2. Mussel and oyster calcification
              may decrease by 25 and 10\%, respectively, by the end of the
              century, following the IPCC IS92a scenario (∼740 ppmv in 2100).
              Moreover, mussels dissolve at pCO2 values exceeding a threshold
              value of ∼1800 ppmv. As these two species are important ecosystem
              engineers in coastal ecosystems and represent a large part of
              worldwide aquaculture production, the predicted decrease of
              calcification in response to ocean acidification will probably
              have an impact on coastal biodiversity and ecosystem functioning

  abstract  = "Interest in the field of epigenetics has increased rapidly over
               the last decade, with the term becoming more identifiable in
               biomedical research, scientific fields outside of the molecular
               sciences, such as ecology and physiology, and even mainstream
               culture. It has become increasingly clear, however, that
               different investigators ascribe different definitions to the
               term. Some employ epigenetics to explain changes in gene
               expression, others use it to refer to transgenerational effects
               and/or inherited expression states. This disagreement on a clear
               definition has made communication difficult, synthesis of
               epigenetic research across fields nearly impossible, and has in
               many ways biased methodologies and interpretations. This article
               discusses the history behind the multitude of definitions that
               have been employed since the conception of epigenetics, analyzes
               the components of these definitions, and offers solutions for
               clarifying the field and mitigating the problems that have

  abstract  = "Background Human activities have increased atmospheric
               concentrations of carbon dioxide by 36\% during the past 200
               years. One third of all anthropogenic CO2 has been absorbed by
               the oceans, reducing pH by about 0.1 of a unit and significantly
               altering their carbonate chemistry. There is widespread concern
               that these changes are altering marine habitats severely, but
               little or no attention has been given to the biota of estuarine
               and coastal settings, ecosystems that are less pH buffered
               because of naturally reduced alkalinity. Methodology/Principal
               Findings To address CO2-induced changes to estuarine
               calcification, veliger larvae of two oyster species, the Eastern
               oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and the Suminoe oyster
               (Crassostrea ariakensis) were grown in estuarine water under
               four pCO2 regimes, 280, 380, 560 and 800 µatm, to simulate
               atmospheric conditions in the pre-industrial era, present, and
               projected future concentrations in 50 and 100 years
               respectively. CO2 manipulations were made using an automated
               negative feedback control system that allowed continuous and
               precise control over the pCO2 in experimental aquaria. Larval
               growth was measured using image analysis, and calcification was
               measured by chemical analysis of calcium in their shells. C.
               virginica experienced a 16\% decrease in shell area and a 42\%
               reduction in calcium content when pre-industrial and end of 21st
               century pCO2 treatments were compared. C. ariakensis showed no
               change to either growth or calcification. Both species
               demonstrated net calcification and growth, even when aragonite
               was undersaturated, a result that runs counter to previous
               expectations for invertebrate larvae that produce aragonite
               shells. Conclusions and Significance Our results suggest that
               temperate estuarine and coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to the
               expected changes in water chemistry due to elevated atmospheric
               CO2 and that biological responses to acidification, especially
               calcifying biota, will be species-specific and therefore much
               more variable and complex than reported previously.",

  abstract = "Marine organisms' persistence hinges on the capacity for
              acclimatization and adaptation to the myriad of interacting
              environmental stressors associated with global climate change. In
              this context, epigenetics-mechanisms that facilitate phenotypic
              variation through genotype-environment interactions-are of great
              interest ecologically and evolutionarily. Our comprehensive
              review of marine environmental epigenetics guides our
              recommendations of four key areas for future research: the
              dynamics of wash-in and wash-out of epigenetic effects, the
              mechanistic understanding of the interplay of different
              epigenetic marks and the interaction with the microbiome, the
              capacity for and mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetic
              inheritance, and the evolutionary implications of the interaction
              of genetic and epigenetic features. Emerging insights in marine
              environmental epigenetics can be applied to critical issues such
              as aquaculture, biomonitoring, and biological invasions, thereby
              improving our ability to explain and predict the responses of
