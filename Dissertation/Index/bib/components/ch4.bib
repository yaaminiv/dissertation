  abstract = "Organisms show great variation in ploidy level. For example,
              chromosome copy number varies among cells, individuals and
              species. One particularly widespread example of ploidy variation
              is found in haplodiploid taxa, wherein males are typically
              haploid and females are typically diploid. Despite the prevalence
              of haplodiploidy, the regulatory consequences of having separate
              haploid and diploid genomes are poorly understood. In particular,
              it remains unknown whether epigenetic mechanisms contribute to
              regulatory compensation for genome dosage. To gain greater
              insights into the importance of epigenetic information to ploidy
              compensation, we examined DNA methylation differences among
              diploid queen, diploid worker, haploid male and diploid male
              Solenopsis invicta fire ants. Surprisingly, we found that
              morphologically dissimilar diploid males, queens and workers were
              more similar to one another in terms of DNA methylation than were
              morphologically similar haploid and diploid males. Moreover,
              methylation level was positively associated with gene expression
              for genes that were differentially methylated in haploid and
              diploid castes. These data demonstrate that intragenic DNA
              methylation levels differ among individuals of distinct ploidy
              and are positively associated with levels of gene expression.
              Thus, these results suggest that epigenetic information may be
              linked to ploidy compensation in haplodiploid insects. Overall,
              this study suggests that epigenetic mechanisms may be important
              to maintaining appropriate patterns of gene regulation in
              biological systems that differ in genome copy number.",

              gigas, highly contiguous reference genomes are required to
              support both fundamental and applied research. Herein we report
              the creation and annotation of a chromosome-level assembly for C.
              gigas. FINDINGS: High-coverage long- and short-read sequence data
              generated on Pacific Biosciences and Illumina platforms were used
              to generate an initial assembly, which was then scaffolded into
              10 pseudo-chromosomes using both Hi-C sequencing and a
              high-density linkage map. The assembly has a scaffold N50 of 58.4
              Mb and a contig N50 of 1.8 Mb, representing a step advance on the
              previously published C. gigas assembly. Annotation based on
              Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq resulted in
              identification of âˆ¼30,000 putative protein-coding genes.
              Annotation of putative repeat elements highlighted an enrichment
              of Helitron rolling-circle transposable elements, suggesting
              their potential role in shaping the evolution of the C. gigas

              an enabling resource for genetics and genomics studies to support
              fundamental insight into bivalve biology, as well as for
              selective breeding of C. gigas in aquaculture.",

              subsequent changes in carbonate system including decreased pH,

              only the calcification process but also several other
              physiological and developmental processes in a variety of marine
              organisms, including edible oysters. Nonetheless, not all species
              are vulnerable to those OA threats, e.g. some species may be able
              to cope with OA stress using environmentally induced
              modifications on gene and protein expressions. For example,
              external environmental stressors including OA can influence the
              addition and removal of methyl groups through epigenetic

              expression ``on or off'' as part of a rapid adaptive mechanism to

              proxy, on DNA methylation pattern of an endemic and a

              pediveliger larvae was higher at pH 7.4 than those in control pH
              8.1, however over one-third of the larvae raised at pH 7.4 failed
              to attach on optimal substrate as defined by biofilm presence.
              During larval development, a total of 130 genes were
              differentially methylated across the two treatments. The
              differential methylation in the larval genes may have partially

              gas exchange with the atmosphere and open ocean waters. Elevated
              partial pressures of CO(2) (P(CO(2)); i.e. environmental
              hypercapnia) decrease the pH of estuarine waters and, ultimately,
              extracellular and intracellular pH levels of estuarine organisms
              such as mollusks that have limited capacity for pH regulation. We
              analyzed proteomic changes associated with exposure to elevated
              P(CO(2)) in the mantle tissue of eastern oysters (Crassostrea
              virginica) after 2 weeks of exposure to control (âˆ¼39 Pa P(CO(2)))
              and hypercapnic (âˆ¼357 Pa P(CO(2))) conditions using
              two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry.
              Exposure to high P(CO(2)) resulted in a significant proteome
              shift in the mantle tissue, with 12\% of proteins (54 out of 456)
              differentially expressed under the high P(CO(2)) compared with
              control conditions. Of the 54 differentially expressed proteins,
              we were able to identify 17. Among the identified proteins, two
              main functional categories were upregulated in response to
              hypercapnia: those associated with the cytoskeleton (e.g. several
              actin isoforms) and those associated with oxidative stress (e.g.
              superoxide dismutase and several peroxiredoxins as well as the
              thioredoxin-related nucleoredoxin). This indicates that exposure
              to high P(CO(2)) (âˆ¼357 Pa) induces oxidative stress and suggests
              that the cytoskeleton is a major target of oxidative stress. We
              discuss how elevated CO(2) levels may cause oxidative stress by
              increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) either
              indirectly by lowering organismal pH, which may enhance the
              Fenton reaction, and/or directly by CO(2) interacting with other
              ROS to form more free radicals. Although estuarine species are
              already exposed to higher and more variable levels of CO(2) than
              other marine species, climate change may further increase the
              extremes and thereby cause greater levels of oxidative stress.",

              manipulated or natural variation exists. Here we introduce key
              concepts and definitions of epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA

              current understanding of epigenetics in both fish and shellfish,

              the intention is to induce an 'epigenetic memory' either within
              or between generations to produce a desired phenotype. The second
              key area is epigenetic selection, which, alone or combined with

              profiles of two genetically distinct oyster breeding lines
              following transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2 in order to
              explore the molecular basis of acclimation or adaptation to ocean
              acidification in these organisms. The expression of key target
              genes associated with antioxidant defence, metabolism and the
              cytoskeleton was assessed in oysters exposed to elevated CO2 over
              three consecutive generations. This set of target genes was
              chosen specifically to test whether altered responsiveness of
              intracellular stress mechanisms contributes to the differential
              acclimation of oyster populations to climate stressors.
              Transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2 resulted in changes to
              both basal and inducible expression of those key target genes
              (e.g. ecSOD, catalase and peroxiredoxin 6), particularly in
              oysters derived from the disease-resistant, fast-growing B2 line.
              Exposure to CO2 stress over consecutive generations produced
              opposite and less evident effects on transcription in a second
              population that was derived from wild-type (nonselected) oysters.
              The analysis of key target genes revealed that the acute
              responses of oysters to CO2 stress appear to be affected by
              population-specific genetic and/or phenotypic traits and by the
              CO2 conditions to which their parents had been exposed. This
              supports the contention that the capacity for heritable change in

              reef-building corals, where ocean acidification (OA) and warming

              fragments of the environmentally sensitive Pocillopora damicornis

              resilience to ocean acidification (OA) at the physiological
              level. To understand the molecular basis of this physiological
              resilience, we analysed the gill transcriptome of B2 oysters that
              had been exposed to near-future projected ocean pH over two
              consecutive generations. Our results suggest that the distinctive
              performance of B2 oysters in the face of OA is mediated by the
              selective expression of genes involved in multiple cellular
              processes. Subsequent high-throughput qPCR revealed that some of
              these transcriptional changes are exclusive to B2 oysters and so
              may be associated with their resilience to OA. The intracellular
              processes mediated by the differentially abundant genes primarily
              involve control of the cell cycle and maintenance of cellular
              homeostasis. These changes may enable B2 oysters to prevent
              apoptosis resulting from oxidative damage or to alleviate the
              effects of apoptosis through regulation of the cell cycle.
              Comparative analysis of the OA conditioning effects across

              wild-type oysters have different trajectories of changing gene

              the measurement of DNA methylation at single nucleotide

               triploids were similarly infected by Perkinsus marinus and, to a
               lesser extent, by Haplosporidium nelsoni. In a closer look,
               growth parameters (shell height growth, whole weight, yield, and
               percentage of marketable oysters) were always higher in
               triploids than in diploids regardless of the parental source,
               strongly supporting the superior advantage of triploids. Similar
               results were obtained for cumulative mortality, but to a lesser
               extent as a result of the large variation in mortality for both
               diploid and triploid cohorts among sites, as well as a
               significant site-by-cohort interaction. Our report is the first
               clear illustration of variation for the cumulative mortality
               exhibited among different spawns in triploids, and comes with
               the lesson that care must be taken in experiments in which the
               goal is to test the effect of ploidy on this trait. Our results
               support the notion that selective breeding programs to reduce
               mortality, coupled with triploid production to increase growth,
               can further optimize yield. The best-performing replicate spawn
               had 80\% survival after 2.5 y, and reached an average shell
               height of 92 mm, weighing 142 g.",

              interspecific crosses, but HA grew significantly faster than the
              two intraspecific crosses during the larval stage. The D larval
              rates of all diploids were significantly higher than that of HHA,
              and HHA larvae had significantly lower survival rates than

              higher shell heights than AA and had similar shell heights to HH.
              HA had higher whole weights than AA on the 360th and 480th days.
              In summary, data analysis revealed that HA always exhibited
              positive heterosis at both sites, indicating that it had growth
              advantages regardless of different environmental conditions. At
              both sites, the growth traits of HHA were significantly higher

               Many farmers believe common farming practices, especially when
               performed during hot summer months, may increase triploid
               mortality. The goal of this study was to investigate how diploid
               and triploid oysters react to common stressors imposed by
               farmers: tumbling during size grading and desiccation to prevent
               biofouling. Triploid and diploid oysters were deployed in
               floating cages at 3 farm sites along the US Gulf of Mexico
               coast. In May and July, oysters in 7 cages were subjected to 1
               of 6 stress treatments: 1 of 3 levels of desiccation (18, 24, or
               48 h) mixed with 1 of 2 levels of tumbling (tumbled or not
               tumbled), along with a never handled, submersed control. The

               affected by compounding stressors; that is, treatments with both
               tumbling and the longest desiccation period exhibited slower
               growth. Triploid oysters exhibited a greater increase in
               mortality in response to farm stress than diploid oysters, and
               mortality increased in all oysters subjected to extreme stress
               treatments when compared to the control. Based on this study,

              conditions that are representative of their kelp forest habitat.
              Progeny from these adults were raised in either high (~1050

              quantify over 1500 proteins in larval oysters. Over 7\% of the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Ocean acidification as a result of increased
              anthropogenic CO2 emissions is occurring in marine and estuarine
              environments worldwide. The coastal ocean experiences additional
              daily and seasonal fluctuations in pH that can be lower than
              projected end-of-century open ocean pH reductions. In order to
              assess the impact of ocean acidification on marine invertebrates,
              Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were exposed to one of four
              different p CO2 levels for four weeks: 400 $\mu$atm (pH 8.0), 800
              $\mu$atm (pH 7.7), 1000 $\mu$atm (pH 7.6), or 2800 $\mu$atm (pH
              7.3). RESULTS: At the end of the four week exposure period,
              oysters in all four p CO2 environments deposited new shell, but
              growth rate was not different among the treatments. However,
              micromechanical properties of the new shell were compromised by
              elevated p CO2. Elevated p CO2 affected neither whole body fatty
              acid composition, nor glycogen content, nor mortality rate
              associated with acute heat shock. Shotgun proteomics revealed
              that several physiological pathways were significantly affected
              by ocean acidification, including antioxidant response,
              carbohydrate metabolism, and transcription and translation.
              Additionally, the proteomic response to a second stress differed
              with p CO2, with numerous processes significantly affected by
              mechanical stimulation at high versus low p CO2 (all proteomics
              data are available in the ProteomeXchange under the identifier
              PXD000835). CONCLUSIONS: Oyster physiology is significantly
              altered by exposure to elevated p CO2, indicating changes in
              energy resource use. This is especially apparent in the
              assessment of the effects of p CO2 on the proteomic response to a
              second stress. The altered stress response illustrates that ocean
              acidification may impact how oysters respond to other changes in
              their environment. These data contribute to an integrative view
              of the effects of ocean acidification on oysters as well as
              physiological trade-offs during environmental stress.",

              by switching on the molecular machinery required for sessile life
              and building calcite shells. Metamorphosis becomes a survival
              bottleneck, which will be pressured by different
              anthropogenically induced climate change-related variables.
              Therefore, it is important to understand how metamorphosing
              larvae interact with emerging climate change stressors. To
              predict how larvae might be affected in a future ocean, we
              examined changes in the proteome of metamorphosing larvae under
              multiple stressors: decreased pH (pH 7.4), increased temperature
              (30 Â°C), and reduced salinity (15 psu). Quantitative protein
              expression profiling using iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS identified more than
              1300 proteins. Decreased pH had a negative effect on
              metamorphosis by down-regulating several proteins involved in
              energy production, metabolism, and protein synthesis. However,
              warming switched on these down-regulated pathways at pH 7.4.
              Under multiple stressors, cell signaling, energy production,
              growth, and developmental pathways were up-regulated, although
              metamorphosis was still reduced. Despite the lack of lethal
              effects, significant physiological responses to both individual
              and interacting climate change related stressors were observed at
              proteome level. The metamorphosing larvae of the C. gigas
              population in the Yellow Sea appear to have adequate phenotypic

              triploid oysters were published. Since then, triploid oysters
              have offered many benefits to the oyster industry, such as faster
              growth, improved meat quality, partial sterility, and increased
              survival due to disease resistance. However, the extent of a

              triploid oyster growth rates, a meta-analysis was performed with
              29 published studies using triploid oysters produced by chemical
              induction or by crossing diploid and tetraploid oysters (i.e.,
              ``mated triploids''). The difference in growth rate between
              ploidy was evaluated using natural log transformed response
              ratios (ln[3n/2n]) in a random-effects model weighted by sample
              size. The positive response ratios in 126 of the 148 independent
              experiments showed a significant growth advantage of the triploid
              over the diploid. On average, mated triploids grew 20\% faster
              than diploids in shell height and 49\% faster in whole wet
              weight. While chemically induced triploids had marginally less
              growth advantage than mated triploids, growing on average 8\%
              faster than diploids in shell height and 31\% faster in whole wet
              weight. Response ratios for experiments using mated triploids and
              measuring whole wet weight was significantly affected by species
              and length of study, while response ratios for experiments using
              chemically induced triploids and measuring whole wet weight was

  abstract = "There are increasing concerns that the current rate of climate
              change might outpace the ability of reef-building corals to adapt
              to future conditions. Work on model systems has shown that
              environmentally induced alterations in DNA methylation can lead
              to phenotypic acclimatization. While DNA methylation has been
              reported in corals and is thought to associate with phenotypic
              plasticity, potential mechanisms linked to changes in
              whole-genome methylation have yet to be elucidated. We show that
              DNA methylation significantly reduces spurious transcription in
              the coral Stylophora pistillata. Furthermore, we find that DNA
              methylation also reduces transcriptional noise by fine-tuning the
              expression of highly expressed genes. Analysis of DNA methylation
              patterns of corals subjected to long-term pH stress showed
              widespread changes in pathways regulating cell cycle and body
              size. Correspondingly, we found significant increases in cell and
              polyp sizes that resulted in more porous skeletons, supporting
              the hypothesis that linear extension rates are maintained under
              conditions of reduced calcification. These findings suggest an
              epigenetic component in phenotypic acclimatization that provides
              corals with an additional mechanism to cope with environmental
              change.",

              purpuratus, by examining relationships between changes in DNA
              methylation, transcription, and embryo spicule length. Adult
              urchins were conditioned in the lab for 4 months to treatments
              that represent upwelling (âˆ¼1200 $\mu$atm pCO2, 13Â°C) and
              non-upwelling conditions (âˆ¼500 $\mu$atm pCO2, 17Â°C). Embryos
              spawned from conditioned adults were reared in either the same
              adult treatment or the reciprocal condition. Maternal
              conditioning resulted in significantly differentially methylated
              CpG sites and differential gene expression in embryos, despite no
              evidence of maternal effects on embryo spicule length. In
              contrast, conditions experienced during development resulted in
              significant differences in embryo spicule length.
              Intragenerational plasticity in spicule length was strongly
              correlated to transcriptomic plasticity, despite low levels of
              intragenerational plasticity in CpG methylation. We find
              plasticity in DNA methylation and gene expression in response to
              different maternal environments and these changes have
              similarities across broad functional groups of genes; yet exhibit
              little overlap on a gene-by-gene basis. Our results suggest that
              different forms of environmentally induced plasticity are
              observable across different time scales and that DNA methylation
              dynamics may be uncoupled from fast transcriptional responses to
              the environment and whole organism traits. Overall, this study

  abstract = "Biomineralisation is one of the key processes that is notably
              affected in marine calcifiers such as oysters under ocean
              acidification (OA). Understanding molecular changes in the
              biomineralisation process under OA and its heritability,
              therefore, is key to developing conservation strategies for
              protecting ecologically and economically important oyster
              species. To do this, in this study we have explicitly chosen the
              tissue involved in biomineralisation (mantle) of an estuarine
              commercial oyster species, Crassostrea hongkongensis. The primary
              aim of this study is to understand the influence of DNA
              methylation over gene expression of mantle tissue under decreased
              ~ pH 7.4, a proxy of OA, and to extrapolate if these molecular
              changes can be observed in the product of biomineralisation - the
              shell. We grew early juvenile C. hongkongensis, under decreased ~
              pH 7.4 and control ~ pH 8.0 over 4.5 months and studied
              OA-induced DNA methylation and gene expression patterns along
              with shell properties such as microstructure, crystal orientation
              and hardness. The population of oysters used in this study was
              found to be moderately resilient to OA at the end of the
              experiment. The expression of key biomineralisation related genes
              such as carbonic anhydrase and alkaline phosphatase remained
              unaffected, thus, mechanical properties of the shell (shell
              growth rate, hardness and crystal orientation) were also
              maintained without any significant difference between control and
              OA conditions with signs of severe dissolution. In addition, this
              study makes three major conclusions: 1) higher expression of Ca2+
              binding/signalling related genes in the mantle play a key role in
              maintaining biomineralisation under OA, 2) DNA methylation
              changes occur in response to OA, however, these methylation
              changes do not directly control gene expression, 3) OA would be
              more of a 'dissolution problem' rather than a 'biomineralisation
              problem' for resilient species that maintain calcification rate

              peaked at day 9, but then diminished over time. Calcification

              sequences such as transposable elements, viroids, RNA and DNA
              viruses, and bacterial DNA. Transgenes or their transcripts can
              resemble these cellular invaders in a number of ways, thus making
              them targets of host protective reactions. At least two distinct
              host defense systems operate to silence transgenes. One acts at
              the genome level and is associated with de novo DNA methylation.
              A second line of defense operates post-transcriptionally and
              involves sequence-specific RNA degradation in the cytoplasm.
              Transgenes that are silenced as a consequence of the genome
              defense are revealing that de novo methylation can be cued by
              DNA-DNA or RNA-DNA interactions. These methylation signals can be
              interpreted in the context of transposable elements or their
              transcripts. During evolution, as transposable elements
              accumulated in plant and vertebrate genomes and as they invaded
              flanking regions of genes, the genome defense was possibly
              recruited to establish global epigenetic mechanisms to regulate
              gene expression. Transposons integrated into promoters of host
              genes could conceivably change expression patterns and attract
              methylation, thus imposing on endogenous genes the type of
              epigenetic regulation associated with the genome defense. This
              recruitment process might have been particularly effective in the

              Before inheritance of methylation patterns can be characterized,
              we need a better understanding of how environmental change
              modifies the parental epigenome. To examine the influence of
              experimental ocean acidification on eastern oyster (Crassostrea
              virginica) gonad tissue, oysters were cultured in the laboratory
              under control (491 $\pm$ 49 Âµatm) or high (2550 $\pm$ 211 Âµatm)
              pCO2 conditions for four weeks. DNA from reproductive tissue was
              isolated from five oysters per treatment, then subjected to
              bisulfite treatment and DNA sequencing. Irrespective of
              treatment, DNA methylation was primarily found in gene bodies
              with approximately 22\% of the genome predicted to be methylated
              In response to elevated pCO2 we found 598 differentially
              methylated loci primarily overlapping with gene bodies. A
              majority of differentially methylated loci were in exons (61.5\%)
              with less intron overlap (31.9\%). While there was though there
              was no evidence of a significant tendency for the genes with
              differentially methylated loci to be associated with distinct
              biological processes, the concentration of these loci in gene
              bodies, including genes involved in protein ubiquitination and
              biomineralization suggests DNA methylation may be important for
              transcriptional control in response to ocean acidification.
              Understanding how experimental ocean acidification conditions
              modify the oyster epigenome, and if these modifications are
              inherited, allows for a better understanding of how ecosystems

              polymers, i.e. ubiquitin chains, of at least eight different

              (Linnaeus, 1750), so far this technique has only been
              commercialised for Pacific oysters. Commercial production of
              triploids on the West Coast of North America began in 1985. Since
              then production of triploids has greatly increased and the use of
              tetraploid males to fertilise eggs from diploids to produce
              batches of 100\% triploids has been developed. In 1999/2000,
              triploid Pacific oysters made up 30\% of all Pacific oysters
              farmed on the West Coast of North America. Some hatcheries now
              use tetraploid males instead of chemical or physical stress to
              produce triploids. The rapid uptake of triploid and tetraploidy
              techniques has been facilitated by the almost total dependence
              that these oyster industries have on hatcheries for the supply of
              seed. This industry in the Pacific Northwest of the US and in
              British Columbia, Canada, would not have developed to its current
              size without hatchery seed supplies. Triploids are preferred over
              diploids in summer because diploids are less marketable when in
              spawning condition. There was only limited interest in triploidy
              production in France until 1999, when IFREMER began to make sperm
              from tetraploids available to commercial hatcheries. In
              1999/2000, only 10\% to 20\% of all the hatchery-supplied Pacific
              oyster spat were triploids, but with the use of sperm from
              tetraploid oysters, this could increase sharply. Elsewhere around
              the world, the commercial uptake of triploid oysters has been
              slow to develop. However, in countries where the production of
              Pacific oysters is based on hatchery supply of seed, it is likely
              that with the use of tetraploid oysters, the farming of triploid

              ocean acidification and in situ variation in pCO2 experienced
              seasonally or during vertical migration. More broadly, L.
              helicina antarctica was capable of mounting a substantial
              epigenetic response to ocean acidification despite little
              evidence of metabolic compensation or recovery of the cellular
              stress response in this species at future pCO2 levels.",
