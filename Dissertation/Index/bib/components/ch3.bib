              interest ecologically and evolutionarily. Our comprehensive
              review of marine environmental epigenetics guides our
              recommendations of four key areas for future research: the
              dynamics of wash-in and wash-out of epigenetic effects, the
              mechanistic understanding of the interplay of different
              epigenetic marks and the interaction with the microbiome, the
              capacity for and mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetic
              inheritance, and the evolutionary implications of the interaction
              of genetic and epigenetic features. Emerging insights in marine
              environmental epigenetics can be applied to critical issues such

              calcification site) in adult eastern oyster (Crassostrea

              reared under three experimental pCO2 treatments (``control,'' 580
              $\mu$atm; ``moderate OA,'' 1,000 $\mu$atm; ``high OA,'' 2,800
              $\mu$atm) and sampled at 6 time points (24 h−80 days). We found
              that high OA initially induced an increase in the pH of the
              extrapallial fluid (pHEPF) relative to the external seawater that
              peaked at day 9, but then diminished over time. Calcification
              rates were significantly lower in the high OA treatment compared
              to the other treatments. To explore how oysters regulate their
              extrapallial fluid, gene expression and DNA methylation were
              examined in the mantle-edge tissue of oysters from days 9 and 80
              in the control and high OA treatments. Mantle tissue mounted a
              significant global molecular response (both in the transcriptome
              and methylome) to OA that shifted through time. Although we did
              not find individual genes that were significantly differentially
              expressed under OA, the pHEPF was significantly correlated with
              the eigengene expression of several co-expressed gene clusters. A
              small number of OA-induced differentially methylated loci were

              OA-induced changes in genome-wide gene body DNA methylation and
              gene expression. Gene body methylation, however, was not
              significantly correlated with the eigengene expression of

              importance of carry?over effects in the evolutionary history of
              marine organisms, few studies have considered links between
              life?history stages when determining how marine organisms will
              respond to elevated Pco2, and none have considered the link
              between adults and their offspring. Herein, we exposed adults of
              wild and selectively bred Sydney rock oysters, Saccostrea
              glomerata to elevated Pco2 during reproductive conditioning and
              measured the development, growth and survival response of their
              larvae. We found that elevated Pco2 had a negative impact on
              larvae of S. glomerata causing a reduction in growth, rate of
              development and survival. Exposing adults to elevated Pco2 during
              reproductive conditioning, however, had positive carry?over
              effects on larvae. Larvae spawned from adults exposed to elevated
              Pco2 were larger and developed faster, but displayed similar
              survival compared with larvae spawned from adults exposed to
              ambient Pco2. Furthermore, selectively bred larvae of S.

              Measurement of the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of adult S.

              selectively bred compared with wild oysters and is further
              increased during exposure to elevated Pco2. This study suggests
              that sensitive marine organisms may have the capacity to
              acclimate or adapt to elevated Pco2 over the next century and a

              after 24 h was recorded. Elevated pCO2 caused a lower
              extracellular pH and there was a greater O:N ratio in adult
              oysters exposed to copper. While the two stressors did not
              interact to cause significant effects on adult physiology, they
              did interact to reduce the size and lipid content of eggs
              indicating that energy demand on adult oysters was greater when

              energy, there were no negative effects on early embryonic
              development. In conclusion, elevated pCO2 can interact with

              development and disease and is widely dysregulated in most types
              of cancer. Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled
              the measurement of DNA methylation at single nucleotide
              resolution through methods such as whole-genome bisulfite
              sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. In
              DNA methylation studies, a key task is to identify differences
              under distinct biological contexts, for example, between tumor
              and normal tissue. A challenge in sequencing studies is that the
              number of biological replicates is often limited by the costs of
              sequencing. The small number of replicates leads to unstable
              variance estimation, which can reduce accuracy to detect

  abstract = "Biomineralisation is one of the key processes that is notably
              affected in marine calcifiers such as oysters under ocean

              biomineralisation process under OA and its heritability,
              therefore, is key to developing conservation strategies for
              protecting ecologically and economically important oyster
              species. To do this, in this study we have explicitly chosen the
              tissue involved in biomineralisation (mantle) of an estuarine
              commercial oyster species, Crassostrea hongkongensis. The primary
              aim of this study is to understand the influence of DNA
              methylation over gene expression of mantle tissue under decreased
              ~ pH 7.4, a proxy of OA, and to extrapolate if these molecular
              changes can be observed in the product of biomineralisation - the
              shell. We grew early juvenile C. hongkongensis, under decreased ~
              pH 7.4 and control ~ pH 8.0 over 4.5 months and studied
              OA-induced DNA methylation and gene expression patterns along
              with shell properties such as microstructure, crystal orientation
              and hardness. The population of oysters used in this study was
              found to be moderately resilient to OA at the end of the
              experiment. The expression of key biomineralisation related genes
              such as carbonic anhydrase and alkaline phosphatase remained
              unaffected, thus, mechanical properties of the shell (shell
              growth rate, hardness and crystal orientation) were also
              maintained without any significant difference between control and
              OA conditions with signs of severe dissolution. In addition, this
              study makes three major conclusions: 1) higher expression of Ca2+
              binding/signalling related genes in the mantle play a key role in
              maintaining biomineralisation under OA, 2) DNA methylation
              changes occur in response to OA, however, these methylation
              changes do not directly control gene expression, 3) OA would be
              more of a 'dissolution problem' rather than a 'biomineralisation
              problem' for resilient species that maintain calcification rate

  abstract = "Background DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that is
              ubiquitous across many eukaryotes, with variable patterns and
              functions across taxa. The roles of DNA methylation during
              invertebrate development remain enigmatic, especially regarding
              the inheritance and ontogenetic dynamics of methylation. In order
              to better understand to what degree DNA methylation patterns are
              heritable, variable between individuals, and changing during
              Crassostrea gigas development, we characterized the genome-wide
              methylome of Crassostrea gigas sperm and larvae from two full-sib
              families nested within a maternal half-sib family across
              developmental stages. Results Bisulfite treated DNA sequencing of
              Crassostrea gigas sperm and larvae at 72 hours post fertilization
              and 120 hours post fertilization revealed DNA methylation ranges
              from 15-18\%. Our data suggest that DNA methylation patterns are
              inherited, as methylation patterns were more similar between the
              two sires and their offspring compared to methylations pattern
              differences among developmental stages. Loci differing between
              the two paternal full-sib families (189) were found throughout
              the genome but were concentrated in transposable elements. The
              proportion of differentially methylated loci among developmental
              stages was not significantly greater in any genomic region.
              Conclusions This study provides the first single-base pair
              resolution DNA methylomes for both oyster sperm and larval
              samples from multiple crosses. Assuming DNA methylation is
              introduced randomly, the predominance of differentially
              methylated loci between families within transposable elements
              could be associated with selection against altering methylation
              in gene bodies. For instance, differentially methylated loci in
              gene bodies could be lethal or deleterious, as they would alter
              gene expression. Another possibility is that differentially
              methylated loci may provide advantageous phenotypic variation by
              increasing transposable element mobility. Future research should
              focus on the relationship between epigenetic and genetic
              variation, and explore the possible relationship of DNA
              methylation and transposable element activity.",

              implications for marine organisms, yet the capacity for species
              to acclimate or adapt over this century remains unknown. Recent
              transgenerational studies have shown that for some marine
              species, exposure of adults to OA can facilitate positive
              carryover effects to their larval and juvenile offspring that
              help them to survive in acidifying oceanic conditions. But
              whether these positive carryover effects can persist into
              adulthood or the next generation is unknown. Here we tested
              whether positive carryover effects found in larvae of the oyster,
              Saccostrea glomerata following transgenerational exposure to
              elevated CO2, could persist into adulthood and whether subsequent
              transgenerational exposure of adults to elevated CO2 would
              facilitate similar adaptive responses in the next generation of
              larvae and juveniles. Following our previous transgenerational
              exposure of parental adults and first generation (F1) larvae to
              ambient (385 $\mu$atm) and elevated (856 $\mu$atm) CO2, newly
              settled F1 juveniles were transferred to the field at ambient CO2
              for 14 months, until they reached reproductive maturity. At this
              time, the F1 adults were returned to the laboratory and the
              previous transgenerational CO2 exposure was repeated to produce
              F2 offspring. We found that the capacity of adults to regulate
              extracellular pH at elevated CO2 was improved if they had a prior
              history of transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2. In
              addition, subsequent transgenerational exposure of these adults
              led to an increase in the resilience of their larval and juvenile
              offspring. Offspring with a history of transgenerational exposure
              to elevated CO2 had a lower percentage abnormality, faster

  abstract = "Predicting how populations will respond to ocean change across
              generations is critical to effective conservation of marine
              species. One emerging factor is the influence of parental
              exposures on offspring phenotype, known as intergenerational
              carryover effects. Parental exposure may deliver beneficial or
              detrimental characteristics to offspring that can influence
              larval recruitment patterns, thus shaping how populations and
              community structure respond to ocean change. Impacts of adult
              exposure to elevated winter temperature and pCO2 on reproduction
              and offspring viability were examined in the Olympia oyster
              (Ostrea lurida) using three populations of adult, hatchery-reared
              O. lurida, plus an additional cohort spawned from one of the
              populations. Oysters were sequentially exposed to elevated
              temperature (+4°C, at 10°C), followed by elevated pCO2 (+2,204
              $\mu$atm, at 3,045 $\mu$atm) during winter months. Male gametes
              were more developed after elevated temperature exposure and less
              developed after high pCO2 exposure, but there was no impact on
              female gametes or sex ratios. Oysters previously exposed to
              elevated winter temperature released larvae earlier, regardless
              of pCO2 exposure. Those exposed to elevated winter temperature as
              a sole treatment released more larvae on a daily basis but, when
              also exposed to high pCO2 , there was no effect. These combined
              results indicate that elevated winter temperature accelerates O.
              lurida spermatogenesis, resulting in earlier larval release and
              increased production, with elevated pCO2 exposure negating
              effects of elevated temperature. Altered recruitment patterns may
              therefore follow warmer winters due to precocious spawning, but
              these effects may be masked by coincidental high pCO2 . Offspring
              were reared in common conditions for 1 yr, then deployed for 3
              months in four estuarine bays with distinct environmental
              conditions. Offspring of parents exposed to elevated pCO2 had
              higher survival rates in two of the four bays. This carryover
              effect demonstrates that parental conditions can have substantial
              ecologically relevant impacts that should be considered when
              predicting impacts of environmental change. Furthermore, Olympia
              oysters may be more resilient in certain environments when
              progenitors are pre-conditioned in stressful conditions. Combined
              with other recent studies, our work suggests that the Olympia may
              be more equipped than other oysters for the challenge of a
              changing ocean.",

              the limited amount of DNA methylation is predominantly found in

              that the role of gene body DNA methylation is dependent on gene

              pressure on lineage-specific life history traits. In genes

              markers to further characterize oyster early gametogenesis,
              mainly through immunofluorescence microscopy. Intense alkaline
              phosphatase activity, a non-specific marker for stem cells, was
              detected on the outer edge of the gonad ducts at the
              post-spawning stage, suggesting an abundance of undifferentiated
              cells very early during the sexual cycle. This observation was
              confirmed using an antibody against Sox2, a transcription factor
              specific for stem or germline cells, which labeled cells in the
              gonad duct inner mass and ciliated epithelium early during the
              initial oyster sexual cycle. Moreover, Vasa, a cytoplasmic marker
              for germline cells, was also detected in the gonad acini and duct
              cells, thus confirming that germline cells were abundant early

              cells was demonstrated by the chromatin-bound
              Ser10-phosphorylated histone H3, a mitotic marker. The markers

              markers, these data reveal that the epithelium delimiting the

              the intention is to induce an 'epigenetic memory' either within
              or between generations to produce a desired phenotype. The second
              key area is epigenetic selection, which, alone or combined with

              animals with desired phenotypes. Based on aspects of life history

              The thecosome pteropod Limacina helicina antarctica is an

              considered a bellwether of ocean acidification as it is highly

              time across different ocean acidification regimes. We exposed L.
              helicina antarctica to pCO2 levels mimicking present-day norms in
              the coastal Southern Ocean of 255 $\mu$atm pCO2, present-day
              extremes of 530 $\mu$atm pCO2, and projected extremes of 918
              $\mu$atm pCO2 for up to 7 days before measuring global DNA
              methylation and sequencing transcriptomes in animals from each

              reduced DNA methylation by 29--56\% after 1 day of exposure to
              918 $\mu$atm pCO2 before DNA methylation returned to control
              levels after 6 days. In addition, L. helicina antarctica exposed

              exploited to devise a Sliding Linear Model (SLIM) to more

              purpuratus, by examining relationships between changes in DNA
              methylation, transcription, and embryo spicule length. Adult
              urchins were conditioned in the lab for 4 months to treatments
              that represent upwelling (∼1200 $\mu$atm pCO2, 13°C) and
              non-upwelling conditions (∼500 $\mu$atm pCO2, 17°C). Embryos
              spawned from conditioned adults were reared in either the same
              adult treatment or the reciprocal condition. Maternal
              conditioning resulted in significantly differentially methylated
              CpG sites and differential gene expression in embryos, despite no
              evidence of maternal effects on embryo spicule length. In
              contrast, conditions experienced during development resulted in
              significant differences in embryo spicule length.
              Intragenerational plasticity in spicule length was strongly
              correlated to transcriptomic plasticity, despite low levels of
              intragenerational plasticity in CpG methylation. We find
              plasticity in DNA methylation and gene expression in response to
              different maternal environments and these changes have
              similarities across broad functional groups of genes; yet exhibit
              little overlap on a gene-by-gene basis. Our results suggest that
              different forms of environmentally induced plasticity are

              Lophotrochozoa) is an alternative and irregular protandrous
              hermaphrodite: most individuals mature first as males and then
              change sex several times. Little is known about genetic and
              phenotypic basis of sex differentiation in oysters, and little
              more about the molecular pathways regulating reproduction. We
              have recently developed and validated a microarray containing
              31,918 oligomers (Dheilly et al., 2011) representing the oyster
              transcriptome. The application of this microarray to the study of
              mollusk gametogenesis should provide a better understanding of
              the key factors involved in sex differentiation and the
              regulation of oyster reproduction. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
              FINDINGS: Gene expression was studied in gonads of oysters
              cultured over a yearly reproductive cycle. Principal component
              analysis and hierarchical clustering showed a significant
              divergence in gene expression patterns of males and females
              coinciding with the start of gonial mitosis. ANOVA analysis of
              the data revealed 2,482 genes differentially expressed during the
              course of males and/or females gametogenesis. The expression of
              434 genes could be localized in either germ cells or somatic
              cells of the gonad by comparing the transcriptome of female
              gonads to the transcriptome of stripped oocytes and somatic
              tissues. Analysis of the annotated genes revealed conserved
              molecular mechanisms between mollusks and mammals: genes involved
              in chromatin condensation, DNA replication and repair, mitosis
              and meiosis regulation, transcription, translation and apoptosis
              were expressed in both male and female gonads. Most
              interestingly, early expressed male-specific genes included
              bindin and a dpy-30 homolog and female-specific genes included
              foxL2, nanos homolog 3, a pancreatic lipase related protein, cd63
              and vitellogenin. Further functional analyses are now required in
              order to investigate their role in sex differentiation in
              oysters. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study allowed us to
              identify potential markers of early sex differentiation in the
              oyster C. gigas, an alternative hermaphrodite mollusk. We also
              provided new highly valuable information on genes specifically

              Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are strongly regulated

              methylated DNA within genomic features (exons, introns,

              patterns after maintaining them for 30 days in a regime of
              oscillating temperatures (26 °C to 34 °C), similar to what is

              early gene expression is mandatory for a normal embryogenesis.
              However, such a regulation and its underlying mechanisms remain
              poorly understood in more distant organisms such as
              Lophotrochozoa. Thus, despite DNA in the oyster genome being
              methylated, the role of DNA methylation in development is
              unknown. To clarify this point, oyster genomic DNA was examined
              during early embryogenesis and found differentially methylated.
              Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction
              indicated stage-specific levels of transcripts encoding
              DNA-methyltransferase (DNMT) and methyl-binding domain proteins.
              In addition, as highlighted by electronic microscopy and
              immunohistochemistry, the DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-cytidine induced
              alterations in the quantity and the localisation of methylated

              plasticity have been identified as mechanisms of acclimation to
              global change, the weight of evidence indicates that parental
              conditioning over generations is not a panacea to rescue stress
              sensitivity in offspring. For many species there were no benefits
              of parental conditioning. Even when improved performance was
              observed, this waned over time within a generation or across
              generations and fitness declined. On the other hand, CGP and MGP
              studies identified resilient species with stress tolerant
              genotypes in wild populations and selected family lines. Several
              bivalves possess favourable stress tolerance and phenotypically
              plastic traits potentially associated with genetic adaptation to
              life in habitats where they routinely experience temperature
              and/or acidification stress. These traits will be important to
              help 'climate proof' shellfish ventures. Species that are
              naturally stress tolerant and those that naturally experience a
              broad range of environmental conditions are good candidates to
              provide insights into the physiological and molecular mechanisms
              involved in CGP and MGP. It is challenging to conduct
              ecologically relevant global change experiments over the long
              times commensurate with the pace of changing climate. As a
              result, many studies present stressors in a shock-type exposure
              at rates much faster than projected scenarios. With more gradual
              stressor introduction over longer experimental durations and in
              context with conditions species are currently acclimatized and/or
              adapted to, the outcomes for sensitive species might differ. We
              highlight the importance to understand primordial germ cell
              development and the timing of gametogenesis with respect to
              stressor exposure. Although multigenerational exposure to global
              change stressors currently appears limited as a universal tool to
              rescue species in the face of changing climate, natural proxies
              of future conditions (upwelling zones, CO2 vents, naturally warm
              habitats) show that phenotypic adjustment and/or beneficial

              point of view, both oyster groups presented typical reproductive
              stages, but showed differential timing, in particular during the
              sequence of spawning and duration of the re-absorption stage.
              Oysters in Baie des Veys had a single partial spawning in August
              and a re-absorption stage that extended until winter. Oysters in
              Merennes-Ol{\'e}ron had a partial spawning in July and massive
              release of gametes during August. Spawnings in both the areas
              were related to maximum temperature (19°C). The quantitative
              analysis showed, on an annual basis, a higher reproductive
              investment by oysters from Baie des Veys, 86\% against 53\% in
              the other group. Larger gonads, higher gamete production, and

              Baie des Veys. Recently, the reproduction pattern and investment
              has been related with summer mortalities; therefore, a

              the creation and annotation of a chromosome-level assembly for C.
              gigas. FINDINGS: High-coverage long- and short-read sequence data
              generated on Pacific Biosciences and Illumina platforms were used
              to generate an initial assembly, which was then scaffolded into
              10 pseudo-chromosomes using both Hi-C sequencing and a
              high-density linkage map. The assembly has a scaffold N50 of 58.4
              Mb and a contig N50 of 1.8 Mb, representing a step advance on the
              previously published C. gigas assembly. Annotation based on
              Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq resulted in

              Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), Reduced Representation Bisulfite
              Sequencing (RRBS), and Methyl-CpG Binding Domain Bisulfite
              Sequencing (MBDBS) --- using multiple individuals from two
              reef-building coral species with contrasting environmental
              sensitivity. All methods reveal substantially greater methylation
              in Montipora capitata (11.4\%) than the more sensitive
              Pocillopora acuta (2.9\%). The majority of CpG methylation in
              both species occurs in gene bodies and flanking regions. In both
              species, MBDBS has the greatest capacity for detecting CpGs in
              coding regions at our sequencing depth, however MBDBS may be
              limited by intra-sample methylation heterogeneity. RRBS yields
              robust information for specific loci albeit without enrichment of
              any particular genome feature and with significantly reduced
              genome coverage. Relative genome size strongly influences the
              number and location of CpGs detected by each method when
              sequencing depth is limited, illuminating nuances in
              cross-species comparisons. These findings reinforce the role and

              acclimated during gametogenesis to upwelling (~1300 $\mu$atm pCO2

              conditions that are representative of their kelp forest habitat.
              Progeny from these adults were raised in either high (~1050
              $\mu$atm) or low (~450 $\mu$atm) pCO2 treatments and sampled at

              methylation has been well studied in mammals, data are limited in
              invertebrates, particularly Mollusca. The Pacific oyster
              Crassostrea gigas is an emerging genetic model for functional
              analysis of DNA methylation in Mollusca. Recent studies have
              shown that there is a positive association between methylation
              status and gene expression in C. gigas; however, whether this
              association exists at the exon level remains to be determined.
              RESULTS: In this study, we characterized the genome-wide
              methylation pattern across two different tissues of C. gigas and
              found that methylated genes are expressed in more tissues and
              development stages than unmethylated genes. Furthermore, we found
              that different types of exons had different methylation levels,
              with the lowest methylation levels in the first exons, followed
              by the last exons, and the internal exons. We found that the
              exons included in the gene transcript contained significantly
              higher DNA methylation levels than skipped exons. We observed
              that the DNA methylation levels increased slowly after the start
              sites and end sites of exons seperately, and then decreased
              quickly towards the middle sites of exons. We also found that
              methylated exons were significantly longer than unmethylated
              exons. CONCLUSION: This study constitutes the first genome-wide
              analysis to show an association between exon-level DNA
              methylation and mRNA expression in the oyster. Our findings
              suggest that exon-level DNA methylation may play a role in the
              construction of alternative splicing by positively influencing
              exon inclusion during transcription.",

               DNA methylation have the capacity to create rapid changes in

               mechanisms that modify gene expression, and may do so in marine

              retain consistent term similarities within clusters. Results We
              propose a new method named binary cut for clustering similarity
              matrices of functional terms. Through comprehensive benchmarks on
              both simulated and real-world datasets, we demonstrated that
              binary cut can efficiently cluster functional terms into groups
              where terms showed more consistent similarities within groups and
              were more mutually exclusive between groups. We compared binary
              cut clustering on the similarity matrices from different
              similarity measures and found that the semantic similarity worked
              well with binary cut while the similarity matrices based on gene
              overlap showed less consistent patterns and they were not

              Before inheritance of methylation patterns can be characterized,
              we need a better understanding of how environmental change
              modifies the parental epigenome. To examine the influence of
              experimental ocean acidification on eastern oyster (Crassostrea
              virginica) gonad tissue, oysters were cultured in the laboratory
              under control (491 $\pm$ 49 µatm) or high (2550 $\pm$ 211 µatm)
              pCO2 conditions for four weeks. DNA from reproductive tissue was
              isolated from five oysters per treatment, then subjected to
              bisulfite treatment and DNA sequencing. Irrespective of
              treatment, DNA methylation was primarily found in gene bodies
              with approximately 22\% of the genome predicted to be methylated
              In response to elevated pCO2 we found 598 differentially
              methylated loci primarily overlapping with gene bodies. A
              majority of differentially methylated loci were in exons (61.5\%)
              with less intron overlap (31.9\%). While there was though there
              was no evidence of a significant tendency for the genes with
              differentially methylated loci to be associated with distinct

              bodies, including genes involved in protein ubiquitination and
              biomineralization suggests DNA methylation may be important for
              transcriptional control in response to ocean acidification.
              Understanding how experimental ocean acidification conditions
              modify the oyster epigenome, and if these modifications are

              environmentally induced alterations in DNA methylation can lead
              to phenotypic acclimatization. While DNA methylation has been
              reported in corals and is thought to associate with phenotypic
              plasticity, potential mechanisms linked to changes in
              whole-genome methylation have yet to be elucidated. We show that
              DNA methylation significantly reduces spurious transcription in
              the coral Stylophora pistillata. Furthermore, we find that DNA
              methylation also reduces transcriptional noise by fine-tuning the
              expression of highly expressed genes. Analysis of DNA methylation
              patterns of corals subjected to long-term pH stress showed
              widespread changes in pathways regulating cell cycle and body

              from early developing stage to resorbing stage, from 28.86 to
              34.53\% in ovaries, while it increased from 31.20 to 35.46\% in

              physiological and developmental processes in a variety of marine
              organisms, including edible oysters. Nonetheless, not all species
              are vulnerable to those OA threats, e.g. some species may be able
              to cope with OA stress using environmentally induced
              modifications on gene and protein expressions. For example,
              external environmental stressors including OA can influence the
              addition and removal of methyl groups through epigenetic
              modification (e.g. DNA methylation) process to turn gene
              expression ``on or off'' as part of a rapid adaptive mechanism to
              cope with OA. In this study, we tested the above hypothesis

              pediveliger larvae was higher at pH 7.4 than those in control pH
              8.1, however over one-third of the larvae raised at pH 7.4 failed
              to attach on optimal substrate as defined by biofilm presence.
              During larval development, a total of 130 genes were
              differentially methylated across the two treatments. The
              differential methylation in the larval genes may have partially
              accounted for the higher metamorphosis success rate under

              crayfish. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of multiple
              replicates and different tissues revealed a methylation pattern
              that is characterized by gene body methylation of housekeeping

              suggesting a function that is unrelated to cell fate

              chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression patterns revealed
              that gene body methylation correlated with limited chromatin
              accessibility and stable gene expression, while low-methylated
              genes often resided in chromatin with higher accessibility and
