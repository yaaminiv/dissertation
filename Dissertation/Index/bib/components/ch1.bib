              of cadmium (Cd) in their soft tissues, but the molecular
              mechanisms of Cd toxicity remain speculative. In this study,
              Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were exposed to Cd for 9 days
              and their gills were subjected to proteomic analysis, which were
              further confirmed with transcriptomic analysis. A total of 4,964
              proteins was quantified and 515 differentially expressed proteins
              were identified in response to Cd exposure. Gene Ontology
              enrichment analysis revealed that excess Cd affected the DNA and
              protein metabolism. Specifically, Cd toxicity resulted in the
              inhibition of DNA glycosylase and gap-filling and ligation
              enzymes expressions in base excision repair pathway, which may
              have decreased DNA repair capacity. At the protein level, Cd
              induced the heat shock protein response, initiation of protein
              refolding as well as degradation by ubiquitin proteasome pathway,
              among other effects. Excess Cd also induced antioxidant
              responses, particularly glutathione metabolism, which play
              important roles in Cd chelation and anti-oxidation. This study
              provided the first molecular mechanisms of Cd toxicity on DNA and
              protein metabolism at protein levels, and identified molecular
              biomarkers for Cd toxicity in oysters.",
