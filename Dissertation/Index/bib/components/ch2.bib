              sometimes also rapidly within hours due to upwelling events. We
              studied if copepod zooplankton living in a fluctuating
              environment are tolerant to climate change effects predicted for
              2100, i.e., a temperature increase of 3°C and a pH decrease of
              0.4. Egg production of the copepod Acartia sp. was followed over
              five consecutive days at four temperature and pH conditions
              (17°C/ambient pH; 17°C/low pH; 20°C/ambient pH; 20°C/low pH). Egg
              production was higher in treatments with warmer temperature but
              the increase was smaller when copepods were simultaneously
              exposed to warmer temperature and lowered pH. To reveal if
              maternal effects are important in terms of adaptation to a
              changing environment, we conducted an egg transplantation
              experiment, where the produced eggs were moved to a different
              environment and egg hatching was monitored for three days. When
              pH changed between the egg production and hatching conditions, it
              resulted in lower hatching success, but the effect was diminished
              over the course of the experiment possibly due to improved
              maternal provisioning. Warmer egg production temperature induced
              a positive maternal effect and increased the egg hatching rate.
              Warmer hatching temperature resulted also in earlier hatching.
              However, the temperature effects appear to be dependent on the
              ambient sea temperature. Our preliminary results indicate that
              maternal effects are an important mechanism in the face of

              life?history stages when determining how marine organisms will
              respond to elevated Pco2, and none have considered the link
              between adults and their offspring. Herein, we exposed adults of
              wild and selectively bred Sydney rock oysters, Saccostrea
              glomerata to elevated Pco2 during reproductive conditioning and
              measured the development, growth and survival response of their
              larvae. We found that elevated Pco2 had a negative impact on
              larvae of S. glomerata causing a reduction in growth, rate of
              development and survival. Exposing adults to elevated Pco2 during
              reproductive conditioning, however, had positive carry?over
              effects on larvae. Larvae spawned from adults exposed to elevated
              Pco2 were larger and developed faster, but displayed similar
              survival compared with larvae spawned from adults exposed to
              ambient Pco2. Furthermore, selectively bred larvae of S.

              acclimate or adapt to elevated Pco2 over the next century and a

              stage, hatch length, final length, and growth rates were affected

              Concentrations of 27 FAs in the unfertilized eggs of each female

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Ocean acidification as a result of increased
              anthropogenic CO2 emissions is occurring in marine and estuarine
              environments worldwide. The coastal ocean experiences additional
              daily and seasonal fluctuations in pH that can be lower than
              projected end-of-century open ocean pH reductions. In order to
              assess the impact of ocean acidification on marine invertebrates,
              Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were exposed to one of four
              different p CO2 levels for four weeks: 400 $\mu$atm (pH 8.0), 800
              $\mu$atm (pH 7.7), 1000 $\mu$atm (pH 7.6), or 2800 $\mu$atm (pH
              7.3). RESULTS: At the end of the four week exposure period,
              oysters in all four p CO2 environments deposited new shell, but
              growth rate was not different among the treatments. However,
              micromechanical properties of the new shell were compromised by
              elevated p CO2. Elevated p CO2 affected neither whole body fatty
              acid composition, nor glycogen content, nor mortality rate
              associated with acute heat shock. Shotgun proteomics revealed
              that several physiological pathways were significantly affected
              by ocean acidification, including antioxidant response,
              carbohydrate metabolism, and transcription and translation.
              Additionally, the proteomic response to a second stress differed
              with p CO2, with numerous processes significantly affected by
              mechanical stimulation at high versus low p CO2 (all proteomics
              data are available in the ProteomeXchange under the identifier
              PXD000835). CONCLUSIONS: Oyster physiology is significantly
              altered by exposure to elevated p CO2, indicating changes in
              energy resource use. This is especially apparent in the
              assessment of the effects of p CO2 on the proteomic response to a
              second stress. The altered stress response illustrates that ocean
              acidification may impact how oysters respond to other changes in
              their environment. These data contribute to an integrative view
              of the effects of ocean acidification on oysters as well as
              physiological trade-offs during environmental stress.",

              adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30°C, produced by mothers
              previously reared at 24°C and then exposed to 18 or 30°C at an
              early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24°C was
              provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with
              greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother-offspring
              temperatures did not match, with respect to when they matched,
              suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect
              triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was
              provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were
              observed when temperatures persisted across generations. In this
              case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30°C may have benefited
              offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of

               females were held at three pHs: ∼8.1 (Ambient), 7.8, and 7.5.
               Exposure to acidified conditions at the larval stage alone had
               minimal effects on the larvae, possibly because larvae may be
               adapted to living in an environment with large pH swings.
               Exposure of Tanner crab larvae to low pH during the embryo phase
               had a more substantial effect on morphology, size, Ca/Mg

              Strait of Juan de Fuca. In order to study the combined effects of
              ocean acidification and other natural and anthropogenic processes
              on Puget Sound waters, we made the first inorganic carbon
              measurements in this estuary on two survey cruises in February
              and August of 2008. Observed pH and aragonite saturation state

              between when seawater enters the sound and when it reaches this

              natural or anthropogenically stimulated respiration processes
              within Puget Sound. Over time, however, the relative impact of
              ocean acidification could increase significantly, accounting for
              49--82\% of the pH decrease in subsurface waters for a doubling
              of atmospheric CO2. These changes may have profound impacts on
              the Puget Sound ecosystem over the next several decades. These

              non methylated regions, which persist throughout development.
              Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are strongly regulated
              during cleavage and metamorphosis. The distribution and levels of
              methylated DNA within genomic features (exons, introns,

              lansdscapes marked by a strong increase in the methylation of

               focused on one biomaterial (secreted calcium carbonate),

               quantify whether reductions in environmental pH alter how
               organisms create biomaterials1. Here, we examine biological
               structures critical for the success of ecologically and
               economically important bivalve molluscs. One non-calcified
               material, the proteinaceous byssal threads that anchor mytilid
               mussels to hard substrates, exhibited reduced mechanical
               performance when secreted under elevated pCO2 conditions,
               whereas shell and tissue growth were unaffected. Threads made
               under high pCO2 (>1,200 $\mu$atm) were weaker and less

               According to a mathematical model, this reduced byssal fibre
               performance, decreasing individual tenacity by 40\%. In the face

              stages, but showed differential timing, in particular during the
              sequence of spawning and duration of the re-absorption stage.
              Oysters in Baie des Veys had a single partial spawning in August
              and a re-absorption stage that extended until winter. Oysters in
              Merennes-Ol{\'e}ron had a partial spawning in July and massive
              release of gametes during August. Spawnings in both the areas
              were related to maximum temperature (19°C). The quantitative
              analysis showed, on an annual basis, a higher reproductive

              describe the decrease of seawater pH caused by the absorption of
              atmospheric CO2. To evaluate the effects of ocean acidification,
              we focused on the larval stage of bivalves, which produce a
              fragile calcareous skeletal structure, very sensitive to changes
              in seawater chemistry. In this context, we investigated sperm
              motility, fertilization rate and larval viability (survival,
              growth and abnormalities) of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea
              gigas, a commercially important bivalve, in a controlled CO2
              perturbation experiment. The carbonate chemistry of seawater was
              manipulated by diffusing pure CO2, to attain two reduced pH
              levels ($\Delta$pH=−0.4 and $\Delta$pH=−0.7) which were compared
              to unmanipulated seawater. The results show high sensitivity of
              C. gigas veliger larvae to low values of pH, as reflected by a
              decrease in survival and growth rates, as well as an increased
              frequency of prodissoconch abnormalities and protruding mantle.
              Moreover, results also show that sperm motility, fertilization
              rate, and hatching success, were negatively influenced by
              acidification. The exposure to $\Delta$pH=−0.7 had a higher
              impact on the fertilization and larval viability than

              prematurely interrupted and disturbed when C. gigas veliger

              of mollusks that are supposedly more sensitive to environmental

              decreased growth rates and increased proportions of abnormal

              attribution to pH induced changes in physiology or changes due to
              a decrease in aragonite saturation state. This study aims to
              assess the impact of several carbonate-system perturbations on
              the growth of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) larvae during
              the first 3 days of development (until shelled D-veliger larvae).

              D-shaped larvae and growth rates were not significantly altered

              transgenerational studies have shown that for some marine
              species, exposure of adults to OA can facilitate positive
              carryover effects to their larval and juvenile offspring that
              help them to survive in acidifying oceanic conditions. But
              whether these positive carryover effects can persist into
              adulthood or the next generation is unknown. Here we tested
              whether positive carryover effects found in larvae of the oyster,
              Saccostrea glomerata following transgenerational exposure to
              elevated CO2, could persist into adulthood and whether subsequent
              transgenerational exposure of adults to elevated CO2 would
              facilitate similar adaptive responses in the next generation of
              larvae and juveniles. Following our previous transgenerational
              exposure of parental adults and first generation (F1) larvae to
              ambient (385 $\mu$atm) and elevated (856 $\mu$atm) CO2, newly
              settled F1 juveniles were transferred to the field at ambient CO2
              for 14 months, until they reached reproductive maturity. At this
              time, the F1 adults were returned to the laboratory and the
              previous transgenerational CO2 exposure was repeated to produce
              F2 offspring. We found that the capacity of adults to regulate
              extracellular pH at elevated CO2 was improved if they had a prior
              history of transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2. In
              addition, subsequent transgenerational exposure of these adults
              led to an increase in the resilience of their larval and juvenile
              offspring. Offspring with a history of transgenerational exposure
              to elevated CO2 had a lower percentage abnormality, faster
              development rate, faster shell growth and increased heart rate at
              elevated CO2 compared with F2 offspring with no prior history of

              carryover effects originating during parental and larval exposure

              where conditions were more benign. We tracked survival and growth
              of outplanted juveniles for 4 months, halfway to reproductive
              age. Survival to metamorphosis in the laboratory was strongly

              and season, the peak intensity of different abiotic stressors can

              investigated whether the costs might affect the magnitude of
              plasticity in this function. To these aims, we exposed adult
              worms to three levels of mating opportunities and measured their
              female and male functions. In our experimental conditions, there
              was no adjustment in the male function, the cheapest function,
              whereas the three species differed in how they adjusted their
              allocation into the female function to mating opportunities. O.
              diadema and O. adherens worms exhibited highly plastic female
              allocation, and plasticity was consistent across three measures
              of female function. In contrast, O. gracilis worms had a fixed
              female allocation, irrespective of mating opportunities.
              Additionally, when the sexual functions were relatively costly,
              their plasticity was greater than when they were relatively
              cheap. However, the magnitude of the plasticity did not depend
              solely on species-specific costs of the function, but also on the
              features of the mating system of each species.",

              freshwater ecosystems. We exposed one generation of D. magna to
              high levels of salinity (F0) and found that the exposure provoked
              specific methylation patterns that were transferred to the three
              consequent nonexposed generations (F1, F2, and F3). This was the

              flowing seawater stream. The system is based on a gas-permeable
              membrane contactor, through which CO2 evolved from an acidified
              seawater stream is continuously and quantitatively stripped by a
              flowing gas stream. The CO2 content of this strip-gas stream,
              which is proportional to the TCO2 of the seawater stream via a
              simple mass balance, is then analyzed using a non-dispersive
              infra-red (NDIR) gas analyzer. Laboratory results have shown that
              the system has an e-folding response time of 6 s and is able to
              resolve changes in signal with better than $\pm$0.1\% precision.
              Independent coulometric analyses of check samples collected in
              the field, analyses of internal check samples, and analyses of
              certified reference materials have shown the accuracy of the
              system to be reliable to $\pm$0.1\%. Coupled with the Lamont
              Pumping SeaSoar system, the TCO2 system has yielded high spatial
              resolution distributions of TCO2 across the New England
              shelfbreak front. These TCO2 data, in conjunction with collocated

              several independent lines of reasoning, indicated that biogenic
              calcium carbonate production may play an important role in

              (Crassostrea gigas) underpins their complex life-history strategy
              by switching on the molecular machinery required for sessile life
              and building calcite shells. Metamorphosis becomes a survival
              bottleneck, which will be pressured by different
              anthropogenically induced climate change-related variables.
              Therefore, it is important to understand how metamorphosing
              larvae interact with emerging climate change stressors. To
              predict how larvae might be affected in a future ocean, we
              examined changes in the proteome of metamorphosing larvae under
              multiple stressors: decreased pH (pH 7.4), increased temperature
              (30 °C), and reduced salinity (15 psu). Quantitative protein
              expression profiling using iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS identified more than
              1300 proteins. Decreased pH had a negative effect on
              metamorphosis by down-regulating several proteins involved in
              energy production, metabolism, and protein synthesis. However,
              warming switched on these down-regulated pathways at pH 7.4.
              Under multiple stressors, cell signaling, energy production,
              growth, and developmental pathways were up-regulated, although
              metamorphosis was still reduced. Despite the lack of lethal
              effects, significant physiological responses to both individual
              and interacting climate change related stressors were observed at
              proteome level. The metamorphosing larvae of the C. gigas
              population in the Yellow Sea appear to have adequate phenotypic

              and fecundity depends on the environment. Theory predicts that
              larger offspring have advantages in adverse conditions, but in
              favorable conditions size is less important. Thus, if
              environmental quality varies, selection should favor mothers that
              adaptively allocate resources in response to local conditions to
              maximize maternal fitness. In the bryozoan Bugula neritina, we
              show that the intensity of intraspecific competition dramatically
              changes the offspring size/performance relationship in the field.
              In benign or extremely competitive environments, offspring size
              is less important, but at intermediate levels of competition,
              colonies from larger larvae have higher performance than colonies

              these expectations in the field by manipulating the density of

              produced larger larvae at high densities and smaller larvae at
              low densities. In addition, mothers from high-density
              environments produced larvae that have higher dispersal
