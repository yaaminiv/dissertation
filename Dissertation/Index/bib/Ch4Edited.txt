   abstract = {ABSTRACT 1 The western Steller sea lion Eumetopias jubatus population has experienced a chronic decline since the 1960s. The causes are likely multifactorial and a combination of anthropogenic and natural factors. A draft revised recovery plan for the Steller sea lion has been published by the US National Marine Fisheries Service, listing both anthropogenic and natural factors that may have contributed to the observed decline or which may be a threat to the recovery of the western Steller sea lion population. The purpose of this review is to consider the anthropogenic threats to this stock. 2 Anthropogenic sources of mortality include fisheries competition resulting in nutritional stress, mortality incidental to commercial fisheries (i.e. fisheries by‐catch), subsistence hunts, legal and illegal shooting, commercial hunts, anthropogenic‐related contamination, and research‐induced mortalities. 3 We present evidence that the following anthropogenic factors likely contributed to the decline of the western Steller sea lion population over the last 40 years: (i) mortality incidental to commercial fisheries (i.e. by‐catch); (ii) commercial hunting of western Steller sea lions; and (iii) legal and illegal shooting; whereas the subsistence hunts for western Steller sea lions and mortality incidental to research were not likely to be contributors to the observed decline. 4 Further, we present evidence that the following can be excluded as significant anthropogenic threats to the recovery of the western Steller sea lion population: (i) mortality incidental to commercial fishing; (ii) legal and illegal shooting; (iii) commercial hunts of Steller sea lions; (iv) subsistence hunting; and (v) mortality incidental to research. 5 Competition with fisheries resulting in nutritional stress, and the potential impacts of contaminants, are two anthropogenic factors that should continue to be a priority for the various organizations currently doing research on this population.},

Based on a mixed layer temperature budget, these anomalies were caused by lower than normal rates of the loss of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere and of relatively weak cold advection in the upper ocean. Both of these mechanisms can be attributed to an unusually strong and persistent weather pattern featuring much higher than normal sea level pressure over the waters of interest. This anomaly was the greatest observed in this region since at least the 1980s. The region of warm sea surface temperature anomalies subsequently expanded and reached coastal waters in spring and summer 2014. Impacts on fisheries and regional weather are discussed. It is found that sea surface temperature anomalies in this region affect air temperatures downwind in Washington state.

   abstract = {Human activities threaten the biodiversity of aquatic mammals across the globe. Conservation of these species hinges on the ability to delineate movements and foraging behaviors of animals, but gaining such insights is hampered by difficulties in tracing individuals over their lives. We determined isotope ratios in teeth (87Sr/86Sr, 13C/12C, and 18O/16O) to examine lifelong movement and resource‐use patterns of a unique freshwater population of a wide‐ranging pinniped species (harbor seal [Phoca vitulina]) that resides in Iliamna Lake, Alaska (U.S.A.). This population's potentially unique migratory behavior and use of different trophic resources are unknown. The isotope ratios we measured in teeth showed that seals were born in the lake, remained lifelong residents, and relied principally on resources produced from in the lake, even when seasonally abundant and nutrient‐dense spawning anadromous fish (i.e., sockeye salmon [Oncorhynchus nerka]) were available in the lake. Our results illustrate how serial isotope records in teeth, particularly 87Sr/86Sr ratios, can be used to quantify how coastal mammal populations exploit both freshwater and marine ecosystems. Understanding lifelong patterns of habitat and resource use is essential information when designing effective conservation plans for threatened coastal mammals. We present the Iliamna Lake harbor seals as a unique case study into how isotope records within teeth can help reveal the cryptic ecology of such a population residing in an intact ecosystem. The results also provide critical baseline information for the Kvichak River system, which is facing an uncertain future due to proposed large‐scale industrial development and a rapidly changing climate. Isotopos Dentales y una Población Críptica de Focas Costeras de Agua Dulce Resumen Las actividades humanas amenazan a la diversidad de mamíferos acuáticos en todo el mundo. La conservación de estas especies depende de la habilidad para delinear los movimientos y los comportamientos de búsqueda de alimento de los animales, pero la obtención de dicha información está obstaculizada por las dificultades en el rastreo de individuos a lo largo del transcurso de sus vidas. Determinamos la proporción de isotopos dentales (87Sr/86Sr, 13C/12C y 18O/16O) para examinar el movimiento a lo largo de la vida y los patrones de uso de recursos de una población única de una especie de pinnípedos de agua dulce con una distribución amplia (foca común [Phoca vitulina]), la cual reside en el lago Iliamna, Alaska (E.U.A.). Se desconocen el comportamiento migratorio potencialmente único de esta población y el uso que le dan a los diferentes recursos tróficos. La proporción de isotopos que medimos en los dientes mostró que las focas nacieron en el lago, permanecieron como residentes de toda la vida y dependieron principalmente de los recursos producidos en el lago, incluso cuando estaban disponibles en aquel lugar por razones reproductivas los peces anádromos abundantes estacionalmente y con densidad de nutrientes (es decir, el salmón rojo [Oncorhynchus nerka]). Nuestros resultados ilustran cómo los registros seriales de isotopos dentales, particularmente la proporción 87Sr/86Sr, pueden usarse para cuantificar cómo las poblaciones de mamíferos costeros explotan tanto los ecosistemas marinos como los de agua dulce. El entendimiento de los patrones ontogénicos del uso de recursos y de hábitat es esencial cuando se diseñan planes efectivos de conservación para los mamíferos costeros en peligro. Presentamos a las focas comunes del lago Iliamna como un estudio de caso único sobre cómo los registros de isotopos dentales pueden ayudar a revelar la ecología críptica de dicha población que reside en un ecosistema intacto. Los resultados también proporcionan información importante de línea base para el sistema el río Kvichak, el cual está enfrentando un futuro incierto debido a la propuesta de un desarrollo industrial de gran escala y al rápido clima cambiante.

The isotopic distributions between algae and gastropods and within algal classes are consistent with those in previous reports, suggesting them to be quite useful for studying food web structure. The nitrogen isotopic variation between amino acids strongly reflects their biosynthetic and metabolic processes. In particular, we suggest here that metabolic fate is an important factor in producing distinct trophic relationships in nitrogen isotopic compositions between amino acids.},

However, because this “amino acid method” has been constructed from the observations of only a few case studies of food‐consumer combinations in previous studies, the universality of the approach remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the δ15N signatures of amino acids in 17 photoautotrophs and the trophic relationships during four controlled feeding experiments using green algae, zooplankton, and fish. The results are consistent with those reported in previous studies, implying that the amino acid method can be applied to a variety of organisms. From these and previously published data, we estimate the two factors (β, isotope differences among amino acids in primary producers; Δ, the 15N‐enrichment factor for each trophic level) required to calculate the trophic level. Based on the lowest error (1σ = 0.12) in the estimated trophic level, we conclude that a comparison of the δ15N values for glutamic acid and phenylalanine is most useful in calculating precise estimates of the trophic level, using the following equation: trophic level (TLGlu/Phe) = (δ15NGlu − δ15NPhe − 3.4)/7.6 + 1.},

   abstract = {Numerous studies have used stable isotope analysis (SIA) of carbon and nitrogen within the bulk tissues of organisms to determine the trophic structure among organisms in a food web. Recently, SIA has evolved to compound‐specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of nitrogen within amino acids to significantly reduce the uncertainty in the estimated trophic position (TP) of organisms based on the isotopic difference between glutamic acid and phenylalanine within a single organism. However, because the initial offset (β) between glutamic acid and phenylalanine differs between aquatic algae (ca. +3.4‰) and vascular plants (ca. −8.4‰) in food webs that rely on both resources, β should be replaced by a value adapted to the admixture of primary producers for each specimen. In this study, we established a new method involving the β value (βmix) of each consumer specimen determined based on its bulk tissue δ13C value and successfully obtained realistic TPs (TPmix) for organisms in a complex seagrass meadow food web. Remarkable differences between the TPmix and traditional TPalgal values were found in deposit feeders due to the large contribution of seagrass to their basal resources. The estimated TPs of organisms increased by up to 1.5 units (from TPalgal to TPmix), in terms of trophic transfer, when their diets included substantial seagrass‐derived contributions. Thus, combinatorial analysis of the amino acid δ15N and specimen‐specific βmix values provides better understanding of the trophic interactions in food webs, even in complex seagrass meadow ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Aim We modelled isoscapes in the Northeast (NE) Pacific using satellite‐based data, with the main objective of testing whether isoscapes defined by a few key parameters can be used as a proxy for secondary productivity. Location Northeast Pacific; 46–60° N and 125–165° W. Time period From 1998 to 2017 (ongoing). Major taxa studied Zooplankton, with a focus on large herbivores. Methods Approximately 280 summer zooplankton samples were analysed for carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope (SI) ratios. Environmental conditions experienced by zooplankton organisms were extracted from satellite, in situ sensor and model databases. A generalized additive model approach was used to explain the spatial variability of δ13C and δ15N values and to predict isoscapes. Results Sea surface temperature (SST), sea level anomaly (SLA) and chlorophyll‐a concentration emerged as the significant SI predictors. Modelled isoscapes reproduced patterns observed in δ13C and δ15N value distribution, such as a decrease from the coast to offshore. The contribution of eddies in enhancing local production in the open ocean was also well captured by the models. In the central part of the NE Pacific, higher SI values were correlated with higher large copepod biomass measured by the North Pacific Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey. However, in the area off the coast of British Columbia, high δ15N variability appeared to be associated with episodic intrusions of coastal waters, demonstrating that caution is needed when interpreting sharp changes in SI ratios. Main conclusions Although the mechanisms driving SI ratio variability are complex, we demonstrate that a few parameters used as a proxy for some of these major mechanisms are able to produce successful isoscape models. This approach was proved useful to provide a qualitative estimate of secondary production, which can be particularly valuable in a region where few data are available.},

   volume = {27},

   abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change will impact nutrient cycles, primary production, and ecosystem structure in the world's oceans, although considerable uncertainty exists regarding the magnitude and spatial variability of these changes. Understanding how regional‐scale ocean conditions control nutrient availability and ultimately nutrient assimilation into food webs will inform how marine resources will change in response to climate. To evaluate how ocean conditions influence the assimilation of nitrogen and carbon into coastal marine food webs, we applied a novel dimension reduction analysis to a century of newly acquired molecular isotope data derived from historic harbor seal bone specimens. By measuring bulk δ13C and δ15N values of source amino acids of these top predators from 1928 to 2014, we derive indices of primary production and nitrogen resources that are assimilated into food webs. We determined coastal food webs responded to climate regimes, coastal upwelling, and freshwater discharge, yet the strength of responses to individual drivers varied across the northeast Pacific. Indices of primary production and nitrogen availability in the Gulf of Alaska were dependent on regional climate indices (i.e., North Pacific Gyre Oscillation) and upwelling. In contrast, the coastal Washington and Salish Sea food webs were associated with local indices of freshwater discharge. For some regions (eastern Bering Sea, northern Gulf of Alaska) food web‐assimilated production was coupled with nitrogen sources; however, other regions demonstrated no production‐nitrogen coupling (Salish Sea). Temporal patterns of environmental indices and isotopic data from Washington state varied about the long‐term mean with no directional trend. Data from the Gulf of Alaska, however, showed below average harbor seal δ13C values and above average ocean conditions since 1975, indicating a change in primary production in recent decades. Altogether, these findings demonstrate stable isotope data can provide useful indices of nitrogen resources and phytoplankton dynamics specific to what is assimilated by food webs. Environmental factors determine resource availability and primary production in marine ecosystems. Stable isotope data from consumer tissues can provide useful indices of nitrogen and carbon resources that are sequestered by primary producers, passed through the food web, and ultimately assimilated into top predators. Based on the stable isotope composition of harbor seal bone specimens from the past century, we determined environmental factors that impact resources assimilated into food webs vary regionally within the northeast Pacific.},

   publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
   pages = {31-54},
   abstract = {IntroductionThe ways in which productivity, stability, population interactions, and community structure are regulated in ecosystems have been a central focus of ecology for over a century. At large spatial scales, major insights into these dynamics have been principally derived from analyses of changes induced from hunting, harvesting, and agricultural practices – so-called “natural experiments.” In terrestrial ecosystems estimates of the fraction of land transformed or degraded by human activity fall within the range of 39 to 75% (Vitousek et al., 1997; Ellis et al., 2010). Equally profound is the reality that up to 75% of the global oceans and in particular the continental shelf, transitional slope water areas, and reef habitats have been strongly impacted by human activity (Halpern et al., 2008).One of the most widely studied human impacts has been the over-exploitation of large-bodied species. Berger et al. (2001) estimated that the spatial distribution of large mammalian carnivores that once played a dominant role in terrestrial ecosystems has declined by 95–99%. In the global oceans large predatory fish biomass may be as low as 10% of pre-industrial levels (Myers and Worm, 2003). These changes have created a vertical compaction and blunting of the trophic pyramid (Duffy, 2003; Chapter 14, this volume). On a global scale, these losses are attributable to a positive association between body size and sensitivity to population declines experienced by larger species which exhibit a greater susceptibility to decline or collapse as a consequence of their lower population densities, greater times to maturity, lower clutch sizes, and larger home ranges (Schipper et al., 2008). This reduction in the abundance of apex predators has led to abnormally high densities of their former prey in a wide range of ecosystems, which has, in turn, resulted in sometimes catastrophic changes in the ecosystems occupied. This has led some to conclude that large-bodied species are essential to the maintenance of ecosystem structure and stability (Hildrew et al., 2007; Estes et al., 2011).},

Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul‐out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend‐count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long‐term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short‐term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.},

We analyze a unique, fishery-independent data set of North Pacific seabird tissues to inform ecosystem trends over 13 decades (1890s to 2010s). Trophic position declined broadly in five of eight species sampled, indicating a long-term shift from higher-trophic level to lower-trophic level prey. No species increased their trophic position. Given species prey preferences, Bayesian diet reconstructions suggest a shift from fishes to squids, a result consistent with both catch reports and ecosystem models. Machine learning models further reveal that trophic position trends have a complex set of drivers including climate, commercial fisheries, and ecomorphology. Our results show that multiple species of fish-consuming seabirds may track the complex changes occurring in marine ecosystems.},

Collagen, irrespective of its origin, contains 19 amino acids, including hydroxyproline which does not occur in other proteins. Its atypical amino acid composition is characterized by high content of proline and glycine, as well as the absence of cysteine. This paper shows the comparison of qualitative composition of amino acids of fish skin (FS) collagen, bovine Achilles tendon (BAT) collagen, and bone collagen. Results demonstrate that FS collagen as well as BAT collagen contains no cysteine and significantly different amount of hydroxyproline. In BAT collagen hydroxyproline content is 30% higher than hydroxyproline content of FS collagen. In bone collagen the amount of hydroxyproline is two times more than in FS collagen. Furthermore, it is shown that sensitivity to radiation of individual amino acids varies and depends on the absorbed dose of ionizing radiation. The changes observed in the amino acid composition become very intense for the doses of 500kGy and 1000kGy.},

   abstract = {The nutritional profile of harbor seal (Phoca vitulina Linnaeus, 1758) diets was determined from scats using a new diet formulation software program and a prey nutritional database developed from proximate analyses of various prey found in Alaskan waters. Scats were collected from Tugidak Island, Alaska, during summers from 2001 to 2009 and prey composition of the diet was estimated using split-sample frequency of occurrence (ssFO) and biomass reconstruction (BR). While 60 different prey items were identified across the collection period, only 21 were found in >10% of scats during at least one sampling period, and an average of 2.6 prey species were identified per scat. Diet diversity was consistently lower in the breeding season than in the molting season. The estimated relative importance of some prey items was significantly different between methods; however, there were no significant differences in the overall estimated protein, lipid, or gross energy composition of the diets. The diet formulation software allows evaluation of the nutritional composition of free-ranging diets using the non-invasive collection of scat. Results from combining the prey database and nutritional composition of diets across years suggest that harbor seals have flexible diets and can maintain nutritional input by taking advantage of seasonally or periodically abundant prey. •Diets estimated using two different diet reconstruction indices were compared.•Nutritional content was estimated using a prey nutritional database.•Diet diversity was consistently lower in the breeding versus molting seasons.•Despite changes in prey consumed, nutritional composition was relatively constant.•Harbor seals can maintain nutritional input despite change in prey availability.},

   volume = {482},
   pages = {265-277},
   abstract = {Compound-specific isotope analysis of individual amino acids (AA) is a rapidly growing tool in ecological studies to assess diet and trophic position (TP) in both modern and ancient foodwebs. We conducted the first controlled feeding study examining δ N values in AAs in a marine mammal (harbor seal ). The pattern of δ N variation among AAs in seals was similar to that observed in other heterotrophs, although exceptions were found with proline and threonine. However, many δ N changes with trophic transfer were very different than those reported for zooplankton and other lower TP marine consumers. In particular the measured trophic enrichment factor (TEF) now broadly used for TP estimation (TEF ) was much lower in harbor seals (~4.3‰) than the current commonly applied value (~7.5‰). Recently published data on wild marine birds (penguins) and elasmobranchs (stingrays) suggests that similar, low TEF values may also be characteristic of these taxa. Together, these data imply that marine mammals and other higher animals have different, but also diagnostic, changes in δ N-AA with trophic transfer vs. organisms examined in previous feeding studies (e.g. zooplankton, bony fish and mollusks), possibly due to dietary protein content, trophic position, and/or form of nitrogen excretion (urea vs. ammonia). Therefore, we propose that for marine mammals, a multi-TEF calculation is required to account for variations of TEF between animals within a food web, and we demonstrate that this approach can predict accurate TP estimates for harbor seals. These results also have significant implication for the application of compound-specific isotope analysis of AAs on terrestrial ecology and trophic structure.},

   abstract = {This study assessed the summer diet and consumption patterns of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) resident in Iliamna Lake, Alaska. The authors predicted that adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a seasonally abundant and nutrient-rich prey source, would dominate diets when available and that seals would preferentially consume the most energetically profitable portion of salmon carcasses. Diet was examined by identifying hard parts of prey found in harbor seal scats, and consumption patterns were measured by collecting carcasses of harbor seal-killed sockeye salmon along island spawning grounds. Salmonids were present in 98% of scats that contained identifiable prey, followed by petromyzontids, osmerids, cottids, coregonids, and gasterosterids. The carcass surveys provided evidence of selective consumption patterns of sockeye salmon body parts. Harbor seals consumed the bodies of nearly all (96.6%) male salmon collected, leaving little but the head. In contrast, the belly and eggs were consumed in 63.6% of the female samples, and the entire body was eaten in only 31.3% of females. The harbor seals in Iliamna Lake thus took advantage of the seasonally abundant adult sockeye salmon by consuming them selectively and as a high proportion of their diet, but they also consumed smaller resident fishes, which presumably sustain them during the rest of the year.},

Structured within lake systems, individual populations display diverse life history characteristics and local adaptations to the variation in spawning and rearing habitats. This biocomplexity has enabled the aggregate of populations to sustain its productivity despite major changes in climatic conditions affecting the freshwater and marine environments during the last century. Different geographic and life history components that were minor producers during one climatic regime have dominated during others, emphasizing that the biocomplexity of fish stocks is critical for maintaining their resilience to environmental change.},

   number = {4},
   pages = {591-601},
   abstract = {Sea lion and seal populations in Alaskan waters underwent various degrees of decline during the latter half of the twentieth century and the cause(s) for the declines remain uncertain. The stable carbon (13C/12C) and nitrogen (15N/14N) isotope ratios in bone collagen from wild Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) from the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska were measured for the period 1951–1997 to test the hypothesis that a change in trophic level may have occurred during this interval and contributed to the population declines. A significant change in δ15N in pinniped tissues over time would imply a marked change in trophic level. No significant change in bone collagen δ15N was found for any of the three species during the past 47 years in either the Bering Sea or the Gulf of Alaska. However, the 15N in the Steller sea lion collagen was significantly higher than both northern fur seals and harbor seals. A significant decline in δ13C (almost 2 ‰ over the 47 years) was evident in Steller sea lions, while a declining trend, though not significant, was evident in harbor seals and northern fur seals. Changes in foraging location, in combination with a trophic shift, may offer one possible explanation. Nevertheless, a decrease in δ13C over time with no accompanying change in δ15N suggests an environmental change affecting the base of the foodweb rather than a trophic level change due to prey switching. A decline in the seasonal primary production in the region, possibly resulting from decreased phytoplankton growth rates, would exhibit itself as a decline in δ13C. Declining production could be an indication of a reduced carrying capacity in the North Pacific Ocean. Sufficient quantities of optimal prey species may have fallen below threshold sustaining densities for these pinnipeds, particularly for yearlings and subadults who have not yet developed adequate foraging skills.},

   abstract = {We measured stable‐nitrogen (δ15N) and stable‐carbon (δ13C) isotope ratios in muscle and hair from 7 northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) from the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, and 27 Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), and 14 harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) from the Gulf of Alaska and coast of Washington State, in order to contrast dietary information derived from isotopic vs. available conventional dietary studies. Stable‐nitrogen‐isotope analysis of muscle revealed that harbor seals were enriched over sea lions (mean δ15N = 18.6‰vs. 17.5‰) which were in turn enriched over northern fur seals (mean δ15N = 16.6‰). Trophic segregation among these species likely results primarily from differential reliance on herring (Clupea harengus), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), and large vs. small walleye pollock (Theregra chalcogramma). According to their δ15N values, adult male Steller sea lions showed a higher trophic position than adult females (mean δ15N: 18.0‰vs. 17.2‰), whereas adult female northern fur seals were trophically higher than juvenile male fur seals (mean δ15N: 16.5‰vs. 15.0‰). Each of these observed differences likely resulted from differential reliance on squid or differences in the size range of pollock consumed. Three northern fur seal pups showed higher δ15N enrichment over adults (mean 17.7‰vs. 15.8‰) due to their reliance on their mother's milk. Stable‐carbon isotope measurements of hair revealed a cline toward more negative values with latitude. Segregation in hair δ13C between Steller sea lions and harbor seals off the coast of Washington (mean δ13C: −13.6‰vs.−15.0‰) reflected the greater association of harbor seals with freshwater input from the Columbia River. Our study demonstrates the utility of the stable isotope approach to augment conventional dietary analyses of pinnipeds and other marine mammals.},

   abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\epsilon} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\epsilon} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

   abstract = {Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) are an ecologically, commercially, and culturally important Alaskan groundfish species. Commercial harvest of halibut dates back to the late 19th century and has been managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) since 1921. IPHC surveys have revealed declining trends in survey biomass in multiple regions and region‐specific declines in mean size‐at‐age (size‐at‐age) over the past two decades (>50% in some areas). Changes in size‐at‐age can arise from a variety of physical, ecological, sampling, and fishery effects, including size‐dependent fishery or predation mortality, alteration in growth from variability in prey quality or quantity, and changes in temperature‐dependent metabolic demands. Here, we develop and apply a bioenergetics model for halibut using survey‐based diet and temperature data for Alaska to evaluate potential environmental drivers of size‐at‐age. In general, juvenile (<40 cm fork length) foraging rates were highest in the Gulf of Alaska concomitant with higher potential growth and elevated basal metabolic demands during warm summer conditions. In contrast, adult (40–120 cm FL) potential growth was highest in the Eastern Bering Sea, potentially reflecting lower metabolic costs and higher rates of prey consumption in that region. We additionally find evidence for interannual variation in potential growth, with a higher frequency of reduced growth potential in the last decade, particularly in the Eastern Bering Sea in 2015 and 2016 for both juvenile and adult halibut. These results suggest the potential for patterns in size‐at‐age to arise from trophic and environmental constraints that collectively limit growth in some regions and years.},

This update incorporates a new release of ICOADS release 3.0 (R3.0), a decade of near-surface data from Argo floats, and a new estimate of centennial sea ice from HadISST2. A number of choices in aspects of quality control, bias adjustment, and interpolation have been substantively revised. The resulting ERSST estimates have more realistic spatiotemporal variations, better representation of high-latitude SSTs, and ship SST biases are now calculated relative to more accurate buoy measurements, while the global long-term trend remains about the same. Progressive experiments have been undertaken to highlight the effects of each change in data source and analysis technique upon the final product. The reconstructed SST is systematically decreased by 0.077°C, as the reference data source is switched from ship SST in ERSSTv4 to modern buoy SST in ERSSTv5. Furthermore, high-latitude SSTs are decreased by 0.1°–0.2°C by using sea ice concentration from HadISST2 over HadISST1. Changes arising from remaining innovations are mostly important at small space and time scales, primarily having an impact where and when input observations are sparse. Cross validations and verifications with independent modern observations show that the updates incorporated in ERSSTv5 have improved the representation of spatial variability over the global oceans, the magnitude of El Niño and La Niña events, and the decadal nature of SST changes over 1930s–40s when observation instruments changed rapidly. Both long-(1900–2015) and short-term (2000–15) SST trends in ERSSTv5 remain significant as in ERSSTv4.},

   abstract = {Fatty acid signature analysis was used to investigate the diet and the spatial scales of foraging in harbor seals Phoca vitulina richardsi in Prince William Sound (PWS) and elsewhere in the Gulf of Alaska. Blubber samples collected in 1994 and 1995 from 104 harbor seals from PWS, Kodiak Island, and southeast Alaska were analyzed for fatty acid composition. A total of 163 potential prey samples representing 10 taxa were collected and individually analyzed for total fat content and fatty acid composition. Approximately 70 fatty acids and isomers were found in both harbor seals and their prey. Classification and regression tree analysis was used to classify seals and prey according to their fatty acid signatures. Large differences were found in the fatty acid composition of blubber from seals sampled at Kodiak, southeast Alaska and PWS, over a broad geographical scale of 400 to 800 km. Additionally, fatty acid signatures distinguished seals from different regions within PWS, as well as on finescale resolutions of specific haulout sites within 9 to 15 km of one another. These findings suggest that seals forage site-specifically. These conclusions are supported by prey fatty acid patterns, which also differed on similarly small spatial scales within PWS. Not only could prey species such as herring Clupea pallasi and pollock Theragra chalcogramma be differentiated from one another using fatty acid signatures, but they could also be distinguished by size-class and location within PWS, reflecting differences in diet with age and as well as with fine-scale habitat. Results from this study are consistent with both satellite data from tagged harbor seals and stomach content analyses of forage fish species in PWS. Although preliminary, analyses suggest that large herring and pollock, as well as flatfish, may have dominated the diet of seals in southern PWS, whereas diets of seals in northern and eastern PWS may have been comprised more of small size classes of herring and pollock, and perhaps other items such as cephalopods, sandlance Ammodytes hexapterus, cod Gadus macrocephalus, and shrimp. We conclude that fatty acid signature analysis will be an important contribution to understanding marine food webs in estuarine and other marine environments.},

   abstract = {Tidewater glacial fjords support the largest populations of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) in Alaska and are a prime destination for tour ships. Chronic disturbance from ships, however subtle, could impact long‐term population stability. We examined variation in abundance and distribution of harbor seals on floating ice in Disenchantment Bay, Alaska, a tour ship destination for over a century with near daily visitation by ships in the spring/summer over the last decade. Counts of seals by aerial transect showed a sharp decline in May, prior to pupping and the first ships arriving; counts rebounded by the end of June remaining high until August. Seal distribution and abundance peaked in 5–7 tenths ice cover; total area of ice cover showed no effect. Despite regular flushing of seals by ships, we found no broad‐scale patterns in seal abundance and distribution that could be explained by ship presence. We cannot rule out mechanisms of long‐term disturbance, difficult to detect and that might explain notable differences with other, similar sites. Population declines at disturbed glacial sites and the still rising popularity of vessel‐based tourism indicate a need for individual‐based studies on how seals respond to the dynamics of glacial ice environments and human‐caused stresses.},

   abstract = {Recovery of severely declining resource stocks often leads to enforced quotas or reduced human access to those resources. Predators, however, do not recognize such restrictions and may be attracted to areas of increased prey abundances where human extraction is being limited. Such targeting by predators may reduce or retard the potential recovery of depressed stocks. In the San Juan Islands, northern Puget Sound, USA, marine reserves were implemented to recover depressed fish populations. We examine the role of harbor seals in the San Juan Islands food web. We describe the temporal and spatial variability in their diet, emphasizing species for which reserves were established (rockfish spp.) and other important depressed stocks, including salmon spp. and Pacific herring . During winter and spring, seals primarily consumed Pacific herring, Pacific sand lance , northern anchovy , and walleye pollock . During summer/fall, adult salmonids composed >50% of the diet and were particularly important in odd-numbered calendar years, when pink salmon spawn. Rockfish were not a primary prey species at any time of the year, suggesting that the abundance of alternative prey species may reduce predation pressure and provide a critical buffer to rockfish predation. The importance of considering increased visitation by marine predators to areas where potential prey are enhanced through restrictions on human extractions should be considered when modeling the efficacy of quotas and reduced access areas, such as marine reserves.},

   abstract = {Many critical ecological issues require the analysis of large spatial point data sets – for example, modelling species distributions, abundance and spread from survey data. But modelling spatial relationships, especially in large point data sets, presents major computational challenges. We use a novel Bayesian hierarchical statistical approach, ‘spatial predictive process’ modelling, to predict the distribution of a major invasive plant species, Celastrus orbiculatus, in the northeastern USA. The model runs orders of magnitude faster than traditional geostatistical models on a large data set of c. 4000 points, and performs better than generalized linear models, generalized additive models and geographically weighted regression in cross‐validation. We also use this approach to model simultaneously the distributions of a set of four major invasive species in a spatially explicit multivariate model. This multispecies analysis demonstrates that some pairs of species exhibit negative residual spatial covariation, suggesting potential competitive interaction or divergent responses to unmeasured factors.},

Here we test the hypothesis that relationships among environmental and community time series are nonstationary in the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem (North Pacific Ocean) over multidecadal time scales. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) is applied to environmental and community data from before and after 1988/1989, corresponding to the timing of an abrupt decline in temporal variance of the Aleutian Low atmospheric pattern, a leading driver of Gulf of Alaska climate. Results show that covariance among local atmosphere and ocean environmental variables weakened simultaneous to the decline in Aleutian Low variance. At the same time, community‐wide responses of 14 fish and crustacean populations to physical forcing weakened, as indicated by nonstationary environment–biology regression coefficients. In line with theoretical predictions, this loss of a shared response to environmental variability was accompanied by weakening community covariance. Individual populations also showed nonstationary relationships with shared trends of community variability. We conclude that assumptions of fixed environmental and community relationships are likely to produce mistaken inference in this ecosystem. Similar concerns may apply in other ecosystems subject to changing climate patterns.},

Here, we show that the physical and ecological conditions mapping onto the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index have changed over multidecadal timescales. These changes apparently began around a 1988/1989 North Pacific climate shift that was marked by abrupt northeast Pacific warming, declining temporal variance in the Aleutian Low (a leading atmospheric driver of the PDO), and increasing correlation between the PDO and NPGO patterns. Sea level pressure and surface temperature patterns associated with each climate index changed after 1988/1989, indicating that identical index values reflect different states of basin-scale climate over time. The PDO and NPGO also show time-dependent skill as indices of regional northeast Pacific ecosystem variability. Since the late 1980s, both indices have become less relevant to physical-ecological variability in regional ecosystems from the Bering Sea to the southern California Current. Users of these climate indices should be aware of nonstationary relationships with underlying climate variability within the historical record, and the potential for further nonstationarity with ongoing climate change.},

While several seals travelled to 50–100 km offshore, virtually all locations were in water <200 m deep. Overall, juvenile seals moved more than adults and had larger home ranges. Movements were significantly affected by month, and age by month and sex by month interactions. In all months, mean distances between successively used haulouts were <10 km for adults and <20 km for juveniles. Mean monthly home ranges varied from <100 km2 to >1,500 km2, and were smallest during June‐July. Mean haul‐out to at‐sea distance was 5–10 km for adults and generally 10–25 km for juveniles.

Summer foraging trip durations were short (X̄ = 16.5 h), increased during August, then did not change significantly over the course of the autumn (X̄ = 55.7 h). Individual lactating females spent a greater proportion of their time on shore during the summer and a greater proportion of their time at sea during the autumn. The amount of time that females nursed their pups also increased significantly from the summer to autumn. Long perinatal periods and short foraging trips during summer indicate that sea lions are likely finding sufficient food nearby. Our data also ...},

   abstract = {Stable nitrogen isotope ratios of whole organisms and tissues are routinely used in studies of trophic relationships and nitrogen flow through ecosystems, yet changes underlying increases in δ15N from food source to consumer are not completely understood. In this study, the δ15N of 16 amino acids in marine planktonic consumers and their food sources were examined using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry of their N-pivaloyl-i-propyl-amino acid ester derivatives. Moderate increases in bulk δ15N with trophic position reflect an averaging of large increases in the δ15N of some amino acids, and little or no change in others. Amino acids showing consistently large increases (e.g., glutamic acid changes by ~7‰ between food and consumer) provide greater scope for defining trophic position than the smaller isotopic changes in bulk material. In contrast, amino acids like phenylalanine show no change in δ15 N with trophic position and therefore preserve information about nitrogen sources at the base of the food web. The ability to acquire information about both trophic level and nitrogen sources at the base of the food web from single samples of consumer tissues offers a powerful new tool for elucidating pathways of N transfer through food webs.},

   abstract = {One explanation for recent declines in the Alaskan Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) population is that the availability of preferred prey has changed. Part of our evaluation of this hypothesis involved the use of conventional radio and satellite-linked time-depth recorder transmitters to compare summer and winter foraging of adult female and young-of-the-year Steller sea lions in Alaska waters. Foraging effort was not significantly different seasonally for postpartum adult females, though females with dependent young in winter may increase their foraging effort. In winter, all adult females made longer trips over larger home ranges and dove deeper. Young sea lions exerted less foraging effort, had the shallowest and briefest dives, and had home ranges intermediate in size to the two groups of adult females. Their foraging ability appears to develop throughout the first year. We conclude that adult female sea lions can exploit prey throughout the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea, and are constrained only by their reproductive status and seasonal changes in prey availability. Young sea lions' diving is more limited because their physiological and behavioral development constrains them from diving like an adult. Perhaps most important, dives remain shallow through the first year. Consequently, young sea lions could be more easily food-limited by changes in prey distribution.},

Two minipigs with an end‐to‐end ileorectal anastomosis received orally equimolar amounts of 15N as ammonium chloride or urea twice a day for 10 days. Samples of blood and ileal digesta were collected before and throughout the 10 days; tissue samples were taken at termination of the experiment. The N‐acetyl‐n‐propyl (NAP)‐ and N‐pivaloyl‐i‐propyl (NPP)‐amino acid esters were evaluated for the determination of the 15N content of lysine and 16 other amino acids ranging from natural abundance to an enrichment of 0.6 APE 15N in a complex mixture of proteinogenic amino acids and several matrices. At natural abundances for all amino acids analysed, NAP and NPP derivatives gave mean precisions of 0.5 and 0.3‰ δ15N, respectively. The mean precision for NPP derivatives at enrichments between 0.42 and 1.10 AP 15N ranged between 1.0–15.0‰ δ15N. 15N from ammonium chloride was incorporated into lysine and in all other amino acids of serum albumin to a 2.5 times higher degree than from urea. Somewhat lower, but significant, lysine enrichments were detected in liver, duodenum and jejunum. After 10 days of ingestion of 15N‐labeled urea a significant 15N enrichment in lysine of serum albumin could not be detected, although lysine in the ileal digesta was significantly labeled by day 5. This is the first report providing evidence that the microflora in the upper gastrointestinal tract of pigs is capable of synthesizing lysine de novo and that this lysine is available for body protein synthesis.},

   abstract = {The relative importance of environmental and intrinsic controls on recruitment in fishes has been studied for over a century. Despite this, we are not much closer to predicting recruitment. Rather, recent analyses suggest that recruitment is virtually independent of stock size and, instead, seems to occur in distinct environmental regimes. This issue of whether or not recruitment and subsequent production are coupled to stock size is highly relevant to management. Here, we apply empirical dynamical modelling (EDM) to a global database of 185 fish populations to address the questions of whether or not variation in recruitment is (a) predictable and (b) coupled to stock size. We find that a substantial fraction of recruitment variation is predictable using only the observed history of fluctuations (~40% on average). In addition, although recruitment is often coupled to stock size (107 of 185 stocks), stock size alone explains very little of the variation in recruitment; In ~90% of the stocks analysed, EDM forecasts have substantially lower prediction error than models based solely on stock size. We find that predictability varies across taxa and improves with the number of generations that have been sampled. In the light of these results, we suggest that EDM will be of greatest use in managing relatively short‐lived species.},

   abstract = {Estimating trophic structures is a common approach used to retrieve information regarding energy pathways, predation, and competition in complex ecosystems. The application of amino acid (AA) compoundspecific nitrogen (N) isotope analysis (CSIA) is a relatively new method used to estimate trophic position (TP) and feeding relationships in diverse organisms. Here, we conducted the first meta-analysis of δ¹⁵N AA values from measurements of 359 marine species covering four trophic levels, and compared TP estimates from AA-CSIA to literature values derived from food items, gut or stomach content analysis. We tested whether the AA trophic enrichment factor (TEF), or the ¹⁵N enrichment among different individual AAs is constant across trophic levels and whether inclusion of δ¹⁵N values from multiple AAs improves TP estimation. For the TEF of glutamic acid relative to phenylalanine (Phe) we found an average value of 6.6 % c across all taxa, which is significantly lower than the commonly applied 7.6 ‰. We found that organism feeding ecology influences TEF values of several trophic AAs relative to Phe, with significantly higher TEF values for herbivores compared to omnivores and carnivores, while TEF values were also significantly lower for animals excreting urea compared to ammonium. Based on the comparison of multiple model structures using the metadata of δ¹⁵N AA values we show that increasing the number of AAs in principle improves precision in TP estimation. This meta-analysis clarifies the advantages and limitations of using individual δ¹⁵N AA values as tools in trophic ecology and provides a guideline for the future application of AA-CSIA to food web studies.},

   abstract = {•This review investigates the sources, cycling, and trophic modification of nitrogen.•δ15N values of amino acids are useful for estimating trophic positions of organisms.•The δ15N value of phenylalanine indicates the δ15N baseline of the food web. Compound-specific isotopic analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA) has emerged in the last decade as a powerful approach for tracing the origins and fate of nitrogen in ecological and biogeochemical studies. This approach is based on the empirical observation that source amino acids (SAAs) (i.e., phenylalanine), fractionate 15N very little (< 0.5‰) during trophic transfer, whereas trophic AAs (TAAs) (i.e., glutamic acid), are greatly (∼6–8‰) enriched in 15N during each trophic step. The differential fractionation of these two AA groups can provide a valuable estimate of consumer trophic position that is internally indexed to the baseline δ15N value of the integrated food web. In this paper, we critically review the analytical methods for determining the nitrogen isotopic composition of AAs by gas chromatography–isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. We also discuss methodological considerations for accurate trophic position assessment of organisms using CSIA-AA. We then discuss the advantages and challenges of the CSIA-AA approach using published case studies across a range of topics, including trophic position assessment in various ecosystems, reconstruction of ancient human diets, reconstruction of animal migration and environmental variability, and assessment of marine organic matter dynamics with new classification of microbial fractionation patterns. It is clear that the CSIA-AA approach can provide unique insight into the sources, cycling, and trophic modification of organic nitrogen as it flows through systems. However, this approach will be greatly improved through continued exploration into how biochemical, physiological, and ecological mechanisms affect isotopic fractionation of individual AAs. We end this review with a perspective on future work that will promote the evolution of the rapidly growing field of CSIA-AA.},

Scats were collected from 1990–1998 on island sites across most of the range of the United States western stock of the species. Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius) were the 2 most common species of prey, followed by salmonids (Oncorhynchus) and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus). An additional 16 species of fish and unidentified cephalopods were considered primary in the diet, either because they occurred in >5% of scats collected across the range in winter and summer or because they consistently occurred among the top 3 prey items in particular islands or island groups. Capelin (Mallotus villosus) occurred at very low frequencies despite their predominance in the diet of Steller sea lions before the 1980s. Regions of diet similarity suggest area-specific foraging strategies, with strong seasonal patterns in consumption of most species of prey. Patterns...},

   abstract = {We investigated the hypothesis that synchronous recruitment is due to a shared susceptibility to environmental processes using stock–recruitment residuals for 52 marine fish stocks within three Northeast Pacific large marine ecosystems: the Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, Gulf of Alaska, and California Current. There was moderate coherence in exceptionally strong and weak year‐classes and correlations across stocks. Based on evidence of synchrony from these analyses, we used Bayesian hierarchical models to relate recruitment to environmental covariates for groups of stocks that may be similarly influenced by environmental processes based on their life histories. There were consistent relationships among stocks to the covariates, especially within the Gulf of Alaska and California Current. The best Gulf of Alaska model included Northeast Pacific sea surface height as a predictor of recruitment, and was particularly strong for stocks dependent on cross‐shelf transport during the larval phase for recruitment. In the California Current the best‐fit model included San Francisco coastal sea level height as a predictor, with higher recruitment for many stocks corresponding to anomalously high sea level the year before spawning and low sea level the year of spawning. The best Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands model included several environmental variables as covariates and there was some consistent response across stocks to these variables. Future research may be able to utilize these across‐stock environmental influences, in conjunction with an understanding of ecological processes important across early life history stages, to improve identification of environmental drivers of recruitment.},

   abstract = {The quality of bone collagen extracts is central to the14C dating and isotope palaeodietary analysis of bone. The intactness and purity of the extracted gelatin (“collagen”) is strongly dependent on the extent of diagenetic degradation, contamination and the type of extraction method. Possible chemical, elemental and isotopic parameters for the assessment of “collagen” quality are discussed. The most important distinction that can be made is the one between contaminated bone (mostly from temperate zones), and bone low in collagen content (mostly from arid and tropical zones). The latter shows more variability in all quality parameters than the former. The natural level of contamination is mostly so low that stable isotopic measurements are not impaired, although14C measurements can be. It is concluded that there is no unequivocal way to detect natural levels of contamination with the discussed parameters, although their use can identify many cases. In low “collagen” bone, the parameters can identify the great majority of problematic samples: although deviations in these parameters do not necessarily mean isotopic alterations, the increased background found in these samples makes most samples unusable.},

   volume = {476},
   pages = {237-249},
   abstract = {While many migratory marine organisms converge at breeding areas, identifying foraging strategies away from these reproductive sites can be challenging. Adult female green turtles regularly migrate thousands of kilometers between nesting and foraging areas, making it difficult to identify foraging habitats that support nesting populations and to understand their feeding strategies. In this study, we use stable isotope analysis to investigate the trophic ecology and spatial distribution of foraging green turtles in the Greater Caribbean. Further, we explore the possibility that adult green turtles, originally considered to be herbivores, may, like their counterparts in the Pacific Ocean, display carnivorous feeding strategies. The wide range of carbon and nitrogen isotope values in bulk epidermis observed in the nesting population at Tortuguero, Costa Rica, could indicate that these turtles feed over several trophic levels. Isotopic niches—or the range of δ C and δ N values, which can be used as a proxy for ecological niche—varied among the 5 green turtle foraging aggregations sampled. Similarly, the isotopic composition of the primary producer also varied substantially with geographic location. However, compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids (AA-CSIA) indicated that individuals in the nesting population with different bulk δ N values feed at the same trophic position. The combined results suggest that spatial differences in the isotopic composition of seagrass at the base of the food web, rather than differences in turtle foraging strategy, contribute to the isotopic variation in the nesting population. This study improves understanding of the foraging ecology of a highly dispersed and migratory species.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},
