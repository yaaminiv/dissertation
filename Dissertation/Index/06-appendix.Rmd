# Appendix 1
## Full analytical details for bulk stable isotopes

Collagen samples have been analyzed for both CSSIA and bulk $\delta^{15}N$ which require 10 mg of purified collagen (100 mg of bone). Preliminary analyses were conducted to determine the highest rate of collagen return from bone sampled from different parts of the skull to minimize destruction. Samples were taken from the internal occipital shelf to maintain external integrity. Bone was decalcified using 0.2 M HCl for 24-72 hours depending on bone thickness, followed by centrifugation and nanopure water rinse. Removal of humic acids was conducted using 0.125 M NaOH for 20 hours. Samples were washed to a neutral pH, then solubilized in 0.01N HCl. Once solubilized samples were blown down under N2 to prevent isotopic fractionation, and freeze dried. Freeze dried collagen was be analyzed for bulk isotopic composition of nitrogen by the UW IsoLab (isolab.ess.washington.edu) using a coupled elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometer following the standard protocols of the laboratory. C:N ratios were calculated from this data, which is a measure of the quality for carbon and nitrogen analyses of bone collagen for isotopic analysis. Only three observations were outside of the acceptable rang of 2.7-3.6; indicating there was no substantial loss of glycine or addition of nitrogen due to microbial processing from mortality, decay, curation, and analysis. 
	
$\delta^{15}N$ of eleven amino acids  were measured in the UW Facility for Compound-Specific Isotope Analysis of Environmental Samples. Samples were prepared following the procedures developed by Popp Marine Lab at University of Hawaii Manoa. Briefly, proteins were hydrolyzed in 6N HCl and purified using a cation exchange column. Amino acids were esterified using isopropanol acetyl chloride, and derivatized via acylation with 4:1 toluene: pivaloyl chloride. Samples were brought up in ethyl acetate and analyzed using a coupled gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometer system (GC-C-irMA; Thermo Scientific Trace GC + GC IsoLink coupled to a Delta V irMS) in continuous flow mode monitoring masses (m/z) 28 and 29 using a db-35 column. For each run a 12 amino acid external standard with known isotopic composition was injected three times followed by sample injections. Samples were injected in triplicate, with the 12 amino acid standard injected every two samples (or six injections). A two-hour column oxidation was performed after 6 samples (25 injections). Samples and standards included norleucine as an internal standard.
	
For each machine run, a linear model was fit for each individual amino acid using the following equation:
	
\begin{equation} 
  Std_{aa} = m_{aa}t + b_{aa}
  (\#eq:std)
\end{equation} 

Where m represents the slope of the precision drift, *t* represents the injection number since last column oxidation, and *Std* represents the $\delta^{15}N$ of an individual amino acid for a standard observation. The data was then corrected using the following equations:

\begin{equation} 
  D_{aa, t} = Std_{aa,t} - True
  (\#eq:diff)
\end{equation} 

Where $D_{aa,t}$ is the difference between an observed standard $\delta^{15}N$ of $Std_{aa,t}$ for a given amino acid at a given injection number and the true $\delta^{15}N$ for that standard. Then:

\begin{equation} 
  Sample_{corrected,aa,t} = Sample_{obs,aa,t} - D_{aa,t}
  (\#eq:sampcorr)
\end{equation} 

Where the drift value, $D_{aa,t}$, is subtracted from the sample value for a given amino acid and a given injection to correct the observed sample values for precision drift since last column oxidation. Mean sample corrected values for the triplicate injections were used for all amino acid $\delta^{15}N$.
