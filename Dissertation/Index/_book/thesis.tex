\chapter{Riparian soil nitrogen cycling and isotopic enrichment in
response to a long-term salmon carcass manipulation
experiment}\label{riparian-soil-nitrogen-cycling-and-isotopic-enrichment-in-response-to-a-long-term-salmon-carcass-manipulation-experiment}

\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Pacific salmon acquire most of their biomass in the ocean before
returning to spawn and die in coastal streams and lakes, thus providing
subsidies of marine-derived nitrogen (MDN) to freshwater and terrestrial
ecosystems. Recent declines in salmon abundance have raised questions of
whether managers should mitigate for losses of salmon MDN subsidies. To
test the long-term importance of salmon subsidies to riparian ecosystems
we measured soil N cycling in response to a 20-year manipulation where
salmon carcasses were systematically removed from one bank and deposited
on the opposite bank along a 2 km stream in southwestern Alaska. Soil
samples were taken at different distances from the stream bank along
nine paired transects and measured for organic and inorganic nitrogen
concentrations, and nitrogen transformation rates. MDN was measured
using \textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N for bulk soils, and
NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} and
NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-} soil pools. Stable isotope
analyses confirmed \textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N was
elevated on the salmon enhanced bank compared to the salmon depleted
bank. However, \textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N values of
plant-available inorganic nitrogen exceeded the
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N of salmon inputs,
highlighting N isotope fractionation in soils that raises significant
methodological issues with standard MDN assessments in riparian systems.
Surprisingly, despite 20 years of salmon supplementation, the presence
of MDN did not cause a long-term increase in soil N availability. This
finding indicates the importance of MDN to ecosystem N biogeochemistry
and riparian vegetation may be overestimated for some systems. Given
that essential nutrients can also be pollutants, we urge more critical
analyses of the role of MDN to inform compensatory mitigation programs
targeting salmon nutrient enhancement.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}

Pacific salmon (\emph{Oncorhynchus spp.}) migration from marine
environments to freshwater spawning grounds is a textbook case of
cross-ecosystem nutrient subsidies, and dozens of studies have
identified the presence of marine-derived nitrogen (MDN) from salmon as
crossing ecosystem boundaries from oceans to freshwaters and into the
terrestrial environment (sensu, (Polis, Power, \& Huxel,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Polis2004}{2004}; Schindler et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Schindler2003}{2003}; Scott M, Richard T, Mary F,
\& Mark S, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Gende2002}{2002}). Declines in Pacific
salmon populations in many areas, caused by human activities
(overharvest, habitat degradation, dams) (Richard et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gustafson2007}{2007}), and the concern over loss
of MDN to coastal watersheds has made restoration of salmon nutrients a
focal point for many management and mitigation strategies. For example,
in the Columbia River Basin where Pacific salmon populations have
declined, legislation requiring compensatory mitigation has led to
nutrient enhancement programs, on the foundation that habitats have lost
critical nutrients from salmon and therefore augmentation is necessary
to maintain ecosystem function (Collins, Marcarelli, Baxter, \& Wipfli,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Collins2015}{2015}).

Salmon bring nutrients, including phosphorus (P) and other compounds in
addition to nitrogen (N), into freshwater and terrestrial food webs
through two pathways: 1) direct consumption of tissues by predators and
scavengers, and 2) autotrophic or heterotrophic assimilation of
nutrients released as salmon spawn, die, and eventually decay (Scott M
et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Gende2002}{2002}). Salmon are enriched in
the heavy isotope of nitrogen (\textsuperscript{15}N) relative to the
light isotope (\textsuperscript{14}N) when compared to terrestrial and
watershed-derived N. This isotopic enrichment has been used to
quantitatively trace the presence of salmon derived nutrients into
watersheds (Schindler et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Schindler2003}{2003}). For example, the
proportion of N derived from salmon ranges from approximately 30\% --
75\% in fish and aquatic invertebrates (Naiman, Bilby, Schindler, \&
Helfield, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Naiman2002}{2002}), 10 -- 90\% in
piscivorous mammals such as bears, and 20 -- 40\% in piscivorous fishes
near salmon spawning grounds (Bilby, Fransen, \& Bisson,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bilby1996}{1996}; Chaloner, Martin, Wipfli,
Ostrom, \& Lamberti, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Chaloner2002}{2002};
Claeson, Li, Compton, \& Bisson,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Claeson2006}{2006}; Hilderbrand et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hilderbrand1999}{1999}).

The annual return of this predictable and abundant, yet temporally
limited, high quality resource drives the foraging ecology of both
terrestrial and aquatic consumers (Quinn, Helfield, Austin, Hovel, \&
Bunn, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}; Schindler et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Schindler2013}{2013}). Carcasses and roe are
documented food sources for over 22 species of mammals, birds (C. J.
Cederholm, Houston, Cole, \& Scarlett,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Cederholm1989}{1989}), fishes (Scheuerell, Moore,
Schindler, \& Harvey, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Scheuerell2007}{2007}), and
invertebrates (Meehan, Seminet-Reneau, \& Quinn,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Meehan2005}{2005}; Winder, Schindler, Moore,
Johnson, \& Palen, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Winder2005}{2005}). Bear
population density, body size, and reproductive output has been
correlated with meat (primarily salmon) consumption, with piscivorous
populations having 55 times higher density than their meat-limited
counterparts (Hilderbrand et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hilderbrand1999}{1999}). In aquatic ecosystems,
salmon carcass abundance has been correlated with elevated growth rates
of invertebrates, and with size, density, and condition factor of
juvenile salmonids (R. E. Bilby, Fransen, Bisson, \& Walter,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bilby1998}{1998}; Wipfli, Hudson, Caouette, \&
Chaloner, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wipfli2003}{2003}).

The presence of MDN has been documented in aquatic primary producers,
though its overall ecological importance remains ambiguous. Via this
bottom-up pathway, salmon supply critical limiting nutrients that can
increase primary and/or bacterial productivity, which are subsequently
transferred to consumers and up through the food web (Chaloner et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chaloner2002}{2002}; Holtgrieve \& Schindler,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Holtgrieve2011}{2011}; M. S. Wipfli, Hudson, \&
Caouette, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wipfli1998}{1998}). Higher salmon
returns are correlated with MDN signatures in lower trophic levels
including zooplankton and periphyton (B. P. Finney,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Finney2000}{2000}; Holtgrieve, Schindler, Gowell,
Ruff, \& Lisi, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Holtgrieve2010}{2010}; Kline Jr et
al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kline1993}{1993}). Both direct ecological
and paleolimnological evidence suggest MDN and P positively influence
primary production in lakes (Moore et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Moore2007}{2007}). For example, commercial
fisheries remove upwards of two-thirds of MDN which would otherwise
enter some freshwater lakes in Alaska, resulting in a 3-fold decline in
algal production (Schindler, Leavitt, Brock, Johnson, \& Quay,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Schindler2005}{2005}). In stream ecosystems, the
decomposition of salmon increases dissolved organic and inorganic
nutrients, including highly available forms such as orthophosphate
(PO\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{3-}) and ammonia/ammonium
(NH\textsubscript{3}/NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}). These
nutrients can stimulate epilithon growth (bacteria and algae), though
the magnitude of this response is highly variable, and dependent on
other growth limiting factors such as sunlight and disturbance
(Janetski, Chaloner, Tiegs, \& Lamberti,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Janetski2009}{2009}; Johnston, MacIsaac,
Tschaplinski, \& Hall, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Johnston2004}{2004};
Mitchell \& Lamberti, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Mitchell2005}{2005}).

In the terrestrial realm, bottom-up effects of MDN from salmon are also
thought to be ecologically important, though this has been difficult to
demonstrate rigorously. Studies across the range of salmon in North
America have inferred that up to 26\% of foliar N in riparian plants is
marine derived, with foliar N levels often correlating with salmon
abundance and distance from the salmon spawning location (e.g., Hocking
\& Reynolds, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hocking2012}{2012}; Reimchen \& Fox,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Reimchen2013}{2013}). While MDN is clearly
present in terrestrial producers, direct evidence of the importance of
MDN for ecosystem function and productivity is much less evident.
Helfield \& Naiman (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Helfield2001}{2001}) measured
tree growth increments in areas with and without salmon and found higher
growth in one species (Sitka spruce) in areas where salmon nutrients
were present, although these findings were later contested on
statistical grounds (Kirchhoff,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kirchoff2003}{2003}). Hocking \& Reynolds
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hocking2012}{2012}) observed decreased
understory plant diversity with increasing salmon abundance, though this
pattern was largely attributed to increased dominance of a single N
tolerant species (salmonberry). Reimchen \& Fox
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Reimchen2013}{2013}) suggested that salmon
abundance increased tree growth, but tree ring
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N values were not related to
salmon abundance; other growth limiting factors such as temperature and
location were important covariates. Most recently, Quinn et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}) examined tree growth
increments in the riparian zone of a small Alaskan stream before and
after a 20-year, \textgreater{} 200,000 kg, salmon carcass manipulation.
In the two decades prior to manipulation, white spruce (\emph{Picea
glauca}) on average grew faster on one bank compared to the other. The
subsequent decades of carcass manipulation enriched the naturally slower
growing side, and were associated with increased growth. However, the
growth effect of the carcasses was smaller than the natural side-to-side
variation, and other important site and landscape factors such as forest
demography, climate, aspect, and water availability were not fully
considered, a common trend in MDN studies of riparian vegetation.

Interpreting the contributions of MDN to terrestrial producers using
stable isotopes is often highly simplified, and does not consider how
variability of N sources and overall N availability may confound
results. MDN analyses apply simple two-source mixing models to infer the
proportion of total N derived from salmon using equation \eqref{eq:MDN}:
\begin{equation} 
  MDN = \frac{SAM-TEM}{MEM-TEM}*100
  \label{eq:MDN}
\end{equation}
\emph{MDN} is the percentage of marine derived nitrogen in a given
sample, \emph{TEM} is the terrestrial end member (\(\delta^{15}N\) value
representing 0\% MDN), \emph{MEM} is the marine end member
(\(\delta^{15}N\) value representing 100\% MDN) which is typically
12.65‰ for sockeye salmon. \emph{SAM} values are the values in a salmon
area and \emph{TEM} is derived from a non-salmon control. When applied
to terrestrial vegetation, the terrestrial end-member for the mixing
models is typically determined by sampling the
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N of the same species of plant
either laterally away from the stream (where MDN contribution is
expected to be small), upstream of barriers to salmon migration, or in
watersheds without salmon. For the salmon end-member, a single value
equal to the average \textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N of
salmon (12.62 ± 0.31 per mille for sockeye salmon) is typically used.

Inherent assumptions with these models therefore include: 1) reference
sites are biogeochemically similar to salmon sites and 2) the isotopic
signature of salmon is unchanged in the soils prior to plant uptake. N
cycling in soils is strongly controlled by position in the landscape and
contains a number of chemical reactions which fractionate N isotopically
(HÖgberg, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hogberg1998}{1998}; Wheeler, Kavanagh,
\& Daanen, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wheeler2014}{2014}) (Figure
\ref{fig:npathways}), therefore these assumptions may not be valid.

Experiments examining the contributions of MDN are often limited by
short timescales, and relatively few experiments investigate changes in
plant-available soil N pools important to plant nutrient uptake and
growth (Collins et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Collins2015}{2015}).
Studies examining spatial and temporal impacts of salmon on soil
inorganic N have identified highly localized responses (effects only
observed \textless{} 30 cm from carcasses) where soil ammonium
(NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}) and nitrate
(NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}) increase for weeks to months
(Drake, Naiman, \& Bechtold, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Drake2006}{2006};
Gende, Miller, \& Hood, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Gende2007}{2007};
Holtgrieve, Schindler, \& Jewett,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Holtgrieve2009}{2009}) and rarely consider
long-term N retention in the system. Experiments typically examine the
contributions of MDN by nutrient addition not nutrient removal; however,
nutrient removal is important for understanding the effects of lower
numbers of salmon returning to coastal watersheds due to fishing,
habitat reduction, and climate change. In addition, previous research
observed a strong effect of watershed slope on
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N in riparian plants and
attributed this to topography concentrating carcasses near streams
(Hocking \& Reynolds, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hocking2012}{2012}).
However, watershed topography also influences soil water content and N
cycling, which affect N isotopes (HÖgberg,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hogberg1998}{1998}) and therefore complicates MDN
assessments.

To resolve the extent to which salmon carcasses contributed MDN to
plant-available N pools and the long-term ecological response to this
subsidy, we present a second study of the 20-year carcass manipulation
experiment described in Quinn et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}). While Quinn et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}) focused on tree growth before
and after the manipulation, the objective of this work was to determine
whether prolonged enhancement and reduction of salmon subsidies altered
long-term soil N cycling, similar to that documented in forests
receiving N fertilizer additions (Lu et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lu2011}{2011}; Prescott, Corbin, \& Parkinson,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Prescott1992}{1992}; Prescott, Kishchuk, \&
Weetman, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Prescott1995}{1995}). If long-term
changes in N availability due to salmon enhancement or reduction were
observed, compensatory nutrient subsidies may be valuable for
maintaining critical ecosystem functions in riparian areas with reduced
salmon returns. If not, then the addition of nutrients as a management
response to low salmon returns may have unintended negative consequences
(sensu Compton et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Compton2006}{2006}).
Specifically, the importance of MDN to riparian ecosystems was assessed
by 1) evaluating the presence of MDN in soils enhanced and depleted in
salmon carcasses through bulk stable isotope analysis of N, 2)
quantifying the response of plant-available N pools
({[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]} and
{[}NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}{]}) and their rate of supply
via mineralization and nitrification, 3) considering how fractionation
in soils may impact mixing model results by measuring
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N of
NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} and 4) comparing these results to
the vegetation responses measured by Quinn et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}) at the same site. This
research fills key knowledge gaps by examining the long-term legacy of
inorganic N pools, both salmon addition and removal, and considering
site variability that may impact the assumption of biogeochemical
similarity between test and control sites, following a 20-year
manipulation.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Site Description and Sample
Collection}}{Site Description and Sample Collection}}\label{site-description-and-sample-collection}

This study was conducted on Hansen Creek, a \textasciitilde{}2 km long,
2\textsuperscript{nd} order tributary to Lake Aleknagik in the Wood
River system of Bristol Bay, AK and uses the same carcass manipulation
described in Quinn et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}).
Briefly, from 1997-2016 an average of 10,853 sockeye salmon returned to
the stream annually. Overstory vegetation is dominated by white spruce
and paper birch (\emph{Betula papyrifera}), and unlike many other
watersheds in the region, it has a low density of symbiotic N2-fixing
alder (\emph{Alnus spp.}) (Helfield \& Naiman,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Helfield2002}{2002}). From 1997-2016 the stream
was surveyed daily during the annual sockeye salmon (\emph{Oncorhynchus
nerka}) run and all dead salmon were removed from the creek and the
river right bank to a distance of about 5 m and tossed onto the river
left bank. To avoid double counting carcasses on the river left bank,
carcasses naturally occurring on the river left bank were also relocated
to a distance of about 5 m, thus all carcasses (with the exception of
those moved by wildlife, see Quinn et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018})) were located between 3 -- 6 m
on the river left bank. Therefore, the right side of the stream
experienced a reduction in carcass density (depletion) while the left
bank received an increase in carcasses (enhancement). Quinn et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}) calculated that prior to
manipulation the both banks averaged 4545.6 kg of salmon annually and
after manipulation the river left bank averaged 13,381 kg of salmon and
the river right bank averaged 2,260 kg of salmon annually, a 9.6-fold
difference. Approximately 108,530 individual fish (in many cases
partially consumed by bears) were translocated over the 20-year period
representing a total of 267,620 kg of salmon, 8,028 kg of N and 1,356 kg
of phosphorus (P) (Quinn et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}). To estimate the mass of
nitrogen added per m\textsuperscript{2} we assumed all salmon were
tossed within 6 m of the creek's edge along the entire 2 km creek, thus
within a 12,000 m\textsuperscript{2} area.

Soil samples were collected from the riparian zone on 13 July, 2017
(prior to arrival of salmon and any carcass manipulation that season)
along nine sets of paired transect sites. Paired transects were used to
control for naturally occurring salmon density. Transects covered the
full 2 km length of the stream and were selected to represent typical
riparian vegetation and high annual carcass abundance. Each transect
included sampling sites at 1, 3, 6, 10, and 20 m from the bank-full
point. Sampling occurred during peak growing season approximately one
week prior to the arrival of the first salmon in the creek. Thus, our
sampling was intended to capture the long-term legacy of MDN
manipulations and specifically avoid short-term pulses following salmon
return that may not represent a system-level change in N availability,
retention, and recycling in soils, and has already been documented in
multiple short-term studies. A 5 cm x 5 cm x 10 cm soil column was taken
for each sample site and the litter layer was removed before storing at
\(4^{\circ}C\) in airtight plastic bags for 48 hours prior to
processing. Nitrogen cycling decreases dramatically with depth, sampling
at this depth includes the O and A horizons where a majority of nitrogen
cycling occurs (Sparks, Soil Science Society of, \& American Society of,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sparks1996}{1996}).

Soil {[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]},
{[}NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}{]}, and N transformations were
measured according to Holtgrieve et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Holtgrieve2009}{2009}). Briefly, we extracted 10
to 12 g of field-moist sieved (\textless{} 2 mm) soil with 100 mL of 2 M
potassium chloride (KCl) by shaking for 60 s, followed by settling for
24 hours prior to filtration through pre-leached Whatman \#1 filter
papers. Approximately 8 mL of filtered extracts were frozen and later
analyzed colorimetrically for
{[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]} and
{[}NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}{]} with an Auto-Analyzer 500
Model (Perstorp Analytical Co, Analytical Service Station, Seattle, WA,
USA). The remaining extract was frozen prior to stable isotope analyses
(see below). To estimate inorganic N transformation rates, a second 10
to 12 g soil subsample was incubated aerobically in the dark for 15 d at
\(20^{\circ}C\) prior to extraction, filtration, and analysis as above.
Net mineralization was calculated as the sum of the change in
{[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]} and
{[}NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}{]} divided by the incubation
duration, and net nitrification was calculated as the change in
{[}NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}{]} over the incubation
duration and represents the conversion of
NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} to
NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}. {[}N\textsubscript{org}{]} was
calculated by taking total soil N concentration,
{[}N\textsubscript{tot}{]} determined by elemental analysis (see below)
and subtracting {[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]} and
{[}NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}{]}. All soil N values were
corrected for gravimetric soil water content (g H2O/g dry soil)
determined by drying 50 to 100 g of field-moist soil at \(105^{\circ}C\)
for 48 h (Klute, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Klute1986}{1986}).

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Stable isotope
analysis}}{Stable isotope analysis}}\label{stable-isotope-analysis}

Fresh soil was freeze dried for 48 h and ground into a uniform powder
(\textless{} 212 \(\mu\)m) using a ball mill prior to analysis for
nitrogen (\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N) and carbon
(\textsuperscript{13}C/\textsuperscript{12}C) stable isotope ratios at
the University of Washington's IsoLab using a Costech Elemental
Analyzer, Conflo III MAT253 for continuous flow-based measurements. This
procedure also provided total carbon and nitrogen concentrations,
{[}C\textsubscript{tot}{]} and {[}N\textsubscript{tot}{]}, and percent C
and N, of the soil samples. Data are reported using standard delta
notation, which describes the per mil deviation in the ratio of heavy to
light isotope relative to accepted international standards, in this case
air and Vienna Pee Dee Belemite (VPDB) for N and C respectively.

For \textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N stable isotope analysis
of NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} and
NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}, KCl extracts were placed in
Erlenmeyer flasks for diffusion using modified methods from D. M. Sigman
et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sigman1997}{1997}) and Holmes,
McClelland, Sigman, Fry, \& Peterson
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Holmes1998}{1998}). To retrieve NH4+ as gaseous
NH3, 300 mg of MgO and an acid trap (1 cm glass fiber filter treated
with KHSO\textsubscript{4} and sealed in Teflon) were added to each
flask, immediately stoppered, sealed with parafilm, and shaken for six
days prior to removal of acid traps to a desiccator for 3 to 4 days. The
same extracts were then shaken uncovered for one day to remove any
remaining NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}. To retrieve
NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-} as NH\textsubscript{3}, another
300 mg of MgO were added to each extract and immediately followed with
75 mg of Devarda's alloy and an acid trap, then processed as above.
Samples were run in four separate batches, for each batch three blanks
(KCl with no soil extract) and three reference standards,
NH\textsubscript{4}Cl and KNO\textsubscript{3} with known
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N, were also run. Batch blanks
showed quantifiable N from the KCl; therefore, a two-source mixing model
correction was applied to both samples and reference standards using
\eqref{eq:blank}:
\begin{equation} 
  \delta^{15}N_{blank corrected} =   \frac{\delta^{15}N_{measured}*(N_{blank,x} + N_{extracted}) - (\delta^{15}N_{blank,x}*N_{blank,x})}{N_{extracted}}
  \label{eq:blank}
\end{equation}
Where \emph{x} represents an individual batch,
\emph{N\textsubscript{blank,x}} is the average measured mass (µg) of
nitrogen in a blank for a given batch, and \(\delta^{15}N_{blank,x}\) is
the average measured \(\delta^{15}N\) of blanks for a given batch.
\(\delta^{15}N_{measured}\) is the \(\delta^{15}N\) value for a given
sample, and \emph{N\textsubscript{extracted}} is the mass of nitrogen
(µg) measured in the sample. A standard correction was then applied to
the blank corrected measurements with \eqref{eq:stand}:
\begin{equation} 
  \delta^{15}N_{corrected} =   \delta^{15}N_{blank,corrected}-(Standard_{measured,x} - Standard_{true})
  \label{eq:stand}
\end{equation}
Where \emph{Standard\textsubscript{measured,x}} is the average measured
value of the standard for a given batch. All reported
\(\delta^{15}N-NH_4^+\) and NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}
values are expressed as the \(\delta^{15}N_{corrected}\), where a blank
and standard correction has been applied. The internal standard of the
\(\delta^{15}N\) of NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-} had a -23.6
to 9.6‰ deviation from its true value, indicating a significant
methodological issue. Given there was not enough sample to refine these
methods and the potential for standard corrections of this magnitude to
be misleading, \(\delta^{15}N\) of
NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-} data are not reported here.

C:N ratio, percent nitrification, and \%C were also calculated to
evaluate N availability and retention across the sites. C:N ratios were
calculated on a mass basis Percent nitrification was calculated as
\eqref{eq:nit}:
\begin{equation} 
 Percent Nitrification =100 * Net Nitrification / Net Mineralization 
  \label{eq:nit}
\end{equation}
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Statistical
analyses}}{Statistical analyses}}\label{statistical-analyses}

We used multi-model selection procedures via Akaike's information
criterion (AIC) to identify how salmon carcass treatment governed a
suite of response variables using the stats v3 and lme4 packages in R.
These response variables were: \(\delta^{15}N\) and \(\delta^{13}C\) of
bulk soil, \(\delta^{15}N\) of NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+},
{[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]} and
{[}NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}{]}, net mineralization and net
nitrification, {[}N\textsubscript{org}{]}, gravimetric water content
(GW), and C:N. For all response variables, candidate models Table
\ref{tab:candmod1} included bank (left vs.~right) and distance from
river's edge. A linear and quadratic interaction structure for bank and
distance were fit for each response variable and these interaction terms
allowed the effect of distance to vary by bank and the effect of bank to
vary by distance. A log\textsubscript{e} transformation was used for the
distance. GW was considered as a covariate for all response variables,
soil {[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]} was considered as a
covariate for net nitrification, and soil {[}N\textsubscript{org}{]} was
considered as a covariate for net mineralization, given
{[}N\textsubscript{org}{]} and
{[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]} function as the substrate
for mineralization and nitrification respectively.
{[}N\textsubscript{tot}{]} was considered as a covariate for
\(\delta^{15}N\) and \(\delta^{13}C\) of bulk soil, and for
\(\delta^{15}N\) of NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}. The best
model was selected from the candidate model set using AIC for each
response variable.

Two model parameters -- bank (left vs.~right) and distance from the
stream -- were used to test salmon carcass and site variability impacts
to soil N cycling. Changing the number of salmon carcasses on each bank
was the primary goal of the manipulation; however, the two banks
potentially differ in aspect, soil type, and drainage, which can affect
nutrient cycling and generate a bank effect unrelated to salmon
manipulation (I. Chapin F. Stuart, Matson, Vitousek, \& Chapin,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chapin2011}{2011}). Notably, the salmon enhanced
bank has a northwest facing slope within 20 m of the creek edge.
Distance from the stream reflects the magnitude of salmon manipulation
because carcasses were placed primarily 3 -- 6 m from the stream's edge.
Other factors such as vegetation, soil type, and water availability can
also change with distance laterally from the stream edge, though such
changes are expected to be more continuous, rather than focused on the
same 3 -- 6 m band where salmon were placed. These differences in
expected lateral patterns in soil properties due to salmon (focused at 3
-- 6 m) verse other factors (more continuous) provide a means to test
whether salmon significantly altered soil patterns in our experiment.

We inferred that salmon significantly influenced a soil property when
that soil property met the following conditions: (a) the property
differed between the study banks, (b) varied with distance from the
stream edge, and (c) displayed a peak response at 3 - 6 m on the salmon
addition bank. All conditions (a, b, c) are required to infer that
salmon significantly altered the soils on the treatment bank. In
contrast, we inferred that support for only one of these parameters
demonstrates underlying site variability in the system. Effects of
natural site variability on soil properties is also an important
component to test. Control sites are typically assumed to be
biogeochemically similar to carcass sites without validating this
assumption, despite control sites often being located at different
stream reaches or on different streams altogether. For each of the nine
response variables, three competing hypotheses were compared, that the
differences in response variables were due to H1) a bank and/or distance
effect that does not demonstrate a peak response between 3 -- 6 m
indicating site variability not caused by salmon manipulation, H2) a
bank and distance effect as a quadratic interaction with a peak between
3 -- 6 m indicting a response to salmon manipulation or H3) no
difference caused by distance and bank indicating support for the other
covariates tested. These hypotheses were tested by categorizing each
candidate model into one of the three hypotheses (Table
\ref{tab:candmod1}) and considering the hypothesis categorization for
the model with the most support, and any additional competing models
with relative support (\(\Delta\)AIC value of \textless{} 2) {[}Burnham
\& Anderson (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Burnham2003}{2003})) for each
response variable under consideration (e.g., {[}NH4+{]}, {[}NO3-{]},
\(\delta^{15}N\), etc.). If models showed support for H2, the effect of
salmon was confirmed by examining whether the response variable peaked
at the salmon enhanced bank between 3 -- 6 m. If this did not occur, the
response is due to site variability and not salmon.

\section{Results}\label{results}

Bulk soil stable isotope analysis indicated that salmon carcasses
enriched the N isotope pools (Table 1). \(\delta^{15}N\) values peaked
between 3 and 6 m from the stream edge, which was the distance salmon
were typically relocated to during the experiment and declined at
distances greater than 6 m. Maximum \(\delta^{15}N\) of bulk soils was
11.8‰ for the salmon enhanced bank and 11.6‰ for the salmon depleted
bank and no observations exceeded the sockeye salmon end-member value of
12.6‰ (Figure \ref{fig:modIsotope}a). \(\delta^{13}C\) was more enriched
at greater distances from the bank and on average was highest at 20 m
(Figure \ref{fig:modIsotope}b). \(\delta^{13}C\) was primarily governed
by distance, with some evidence {[}N\textsubscript{tot}{]} and bank also
had an effect (\ref{tab:suppmod1}).

Salmon carcass manipulation also enriched \(\delta^{15}N\) of soil
NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}. Stable isotope values were
enriched at 3 m from the stream edge on the salmon enhanced bank, and
declined at distances \textgreater{} 3 m. On the salmon depleted bank,
\(\delta^{15}N\) of soil NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} was most
enriched at 1 m and declined with distance (Figure
@ref(fig:modsupp1.2)C). The only model with support contained a
quadratic interaction of distance and bank, which provides strong
evidence that \(\delta^{15}N\) of NH4+ was affected by salmon (Table
\ref{tab:suppmod1}). In contrast to bulk soil N, \(\delta^{15}N\) values
of NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} exceeded the salmon endmember
of 12.6‰ for 23\% of all observations (n=21).

Inorganic nitrogen concentrations were primarily governed by bank and GW
(Table \ref{tab:suppmod1}). The salmon enhanced bank had a higher mean
{[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]} and
{[}NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}{]} compared to the salmon
depleted bank (Figure \ref{fig:modConc}d, e). The most supported models
for both {[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]} and
{[}NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}{]} showed evidence for H1,
that observed differences were not caused by salmon. For
{[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]} there was substantial model
uncertainty, with six competing models receiving relative support (ΔAIC
\textless{} 2) (Table \ref{tab:suppmod1}) but none of the competing
models supported a salmon effect. Two competing models for
{[}NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}{]} supported a site
variability effect and one competing model supported a salmon effect
(Tabe \ref{tab:suppmod1}) and all three contained gravimetric water
content as a covariate. This indicates
{[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]} was driven by site factors
unrelated to salmon while {[}NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}{]}
was driven by gravimetric water content and with some support for salmon
enhancement.

Nitrogen transformation rates were unaffected by salmon carcass
manipulation. Both net nitrification and net mineralization models with
relative support contained N substrate
({[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]} and
{[}N\textsubscript{org}{]} respectively), and the models with the most
support did not include distance or bank. Net mineralization had some
model uncertainty, with four models receiving relative support; however,
all of the competing models supported either H1 or H3 with no support
for a salmon effect. {[}N\textsubscript{org}{]} was the only covariate
included in all of the competing models, indicating
{[}N\textsubscript{org}{]} was the most important covariate tested for
determining net mineralization. Net nitrification had greater model
certainty and both models that received relative support contained
{[}NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}{]} and gravimetric water
content. Similar to net mineralization, these models supported H1 and H3
with no support for H2, the salmon effect, though net nitrification was
slightly higher on average between 3 -- 6 m on the salmon enhanced bank
(Table \ref{tab:suppmod1}). Overall, these results demonstrated the
manipulation of salmon carcasses did not have clearly detectable effects
on N transformation rates.

Both {[}N\textsubscript{org}{]} and GW indicated there are site
differences caused by distance and bank unrelated to salmon carcass
manipulation. On average {[}N\textsubscript{org}{]} was higher on the
salmon depleted bank than the salmon enhanced bank. There was model
support of H1 for both GW and {[}N\textsubscript{org}{]}, indicating
these variables decrease with distance (Table \ref{tab:suppmod1}, Figure
\ref{fig:modConc} h, i). While there was some evidence that there was
both a distance and bank effect on GW, it was not caused by salmon as
the salmon enhanced bank does not show a peak GW at 3 - 6 m from the
stream, which was where there was the highest observed isotopic
enrichment and expected MDN. However, one competing model for
{[}N\textsubscript{org}{]} did support H2, indicating site factors and
salmon may both affect {[}N\textsubscript{org}{]}. However, the mean
{[}N\textsubscript{org}{]} for the salmon enhanced bank was 18.42 mg/g
and 18.97 mg/g for the salmon depleted bank indicating salmon decrease
{[}N\textsubscript{org}{]}, if they affect it at all.\newline 

C:N, percent nitrification, and percent carbon indicate relatively high
nitrogen availability across sampling sites in the Hansen Creek system.
Mean percent carbon was 24.2 and 24.9 on the enhanced and depleted banks
respectively (S3). Soil C:N of bulk isotopes was less than 20 for all
sites, with a mean of 15.8 (enhanced) and 14.2 (depleted). These values
are well below the critical microbial C:N threshold of 29, demonstrating
N is more available to meet microbial metabolic demands relative to C
(Figure \ref{fig:modConc}j). In contrast, percent nitrification was
relatively high with a mean of 64\% and 62\% on the enhanced and
depleted banks (S3).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

This study confirmed that MDN was both present in soils and increased on
the bank enhanced with salmon carcasses for 20 years. However,
plant-available inorganic N pools and N transformation rates measured in
soil during the peak growing season immediately prior to the annual
return of salmon were largely unaffected by salmon enhancement. Even
though the salmon enhanced bank had increased net nitrification compared
to the salmon depleted bank, our analysis found no pattern with distance
from the stream, suggesting that elevated nitrification was caused by
bank characteristics unrelated to salmon carcass density. Given numerous
conventional long-term fertilization experiments worldwide have shown a
consistent pattern of elevated soil inorganic N pools and N
transformations, (HÖgberg, Fan, Quist, Binkley, \& Tamm,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hogberg2006}{2006}; Lu et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lu2011}{2011}), it was surprising that 20 years
of MDN inputs did not clearly accelerate soil N cycling in our study.
Soils are the dominant (\textgreater{} 70\%) sink for added N in forests
worldwide (P. H. Templer et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Templer2012}{2012}) and tree growth in high
latitude conifer forests is often strongly N-limited (Nordin, Högberg,
\& Näsholm, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Nordin2001}{2001}), both of which
should have fostered retention of salmon N inputs to our site. Indeed,
the 20 years of cumulative salmon N additions in the zone near the
stream in our study (\textasciitilde{} 6,690 kg N/ha) greatly exceeded
typical riparian surface soil N pools (500 to 2500 kg N/ha) (Morris \&
Stanford, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Morris2011}{2011}; Perry, Shafroth, \&
Perakis, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Perry2017}{2017}; Walker,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Walker1989}{1989}), suggesting that even partial
retention of salmon N inputs in soils should have increased soil
{[}N\textsubscript{org}{]}. The lack of increase in soil
{[}N\textsubscript{org}{]} due to salmon that we observed is consistent
with the lack of increase in N availability, because soil
{[}N\textsubscript{org}{]} fuels long-term changes in N availability and
recycling via plant uptake, litterfall, and decomposition (Chappell,
Prescott, \& Vesterdal, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Chapell1999}{1999};
Perakis \& Sinkhorn, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Perakis2011}{2011}; Steven,
Joselin, \& David, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Perakis2012}{2012}). Combined
with observations of low C:N and high percent nitrification, this
indicates N from salmon subsidies is not being retained in this system.
Overall, the lack of increase in soil organic and inorganic N
concentrations and N transformations that we observed following 20-year
salmon manipulation raises questions of whether plant growth responses
should be expected at our site.

Prior work at Hansen Creek inferred that MDN stimulated white spruce
growth based on tree ring analyses (Quinn et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}). However, substantial salmon
enhancement corresponding to approximately 669 g/m\textsuperscript{2}
(6,690 kg/ ha) of N and 113 g/m\textsuperscript{2} (1,130 kg/ha) of P
over the past 20 years was unable to overcome pre-treatment differences
in forest growth between banks. For reference, it is estimated white
spruce in floodplain stands require approximately 1.35
g/m\textsuperscript{2}/y of N (F. S. Chapin,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chapin2006}{2006}), which was far exceeded by the
mean change of 33.45 g/m\textsuperscript{2}/y of N added from this
manipulation. Additionally, fertilization experiments apply N on the
order of 100 - 1,000 kg/ha with clear results (Chappell et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chapell1999}{1999}), a much lower application
rate than in this study. Factors such as climate, stand demography, and
site and landscape variability also affect tree growth in this system.
Indeed, white spruce growth response to recent warming across southwest
Alaska depends strongly on tree density (M. Wright, Sherriff, Miller, \&
Wilson, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wright2018}{2018}). Basal area density is
highly variable across our site, differing on average 40\% between
salmon-enhanced and salmon-depleted banks, although the difference was
not statistically significant (Quinn et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}). Ultimately, the hierarchy of
drivers of tree growth in this ecosystem appears to be landscape
position (and associated forest demography) followed by climate and
thirdly, nutrients. All told, a lack of long-term changes in soil
nutrient dynamics and only marginal response in tree growth indicates
that salmon nutrients are not a strong bottom-up force in northern
riparian forest dynamics.

Our \textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N stable isotope data
raise further questions of assessing MDN subsidies to tree growth.
Vegetation typically takes up only 17\% of added N to forests, with
soils instead being the dominant N sink (P. H. Templer et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Templer2012}{2012}). Thus, elevated bulk soil
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N in our study suggests a
potentially significant MDN sink in soil. On the other hand, elevated
bulk soil \textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N may also reflect
increases in soil N fractionation during N cycling and loss under
salmon. Highly localized N pulses (as occur with MDN and other N
subsidies) temporarily exceed plant and soil N sinks, leading to
accelerated N loss via ammonia volatilization, nitrification and nitrate
leaching, and/or denitrification (Perakis,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Perakis2002}{2002}). All of these N loss pathways
favor 14N and discriminate against 15N (in some cases with a
fractionation up to 30‰), and effects are strongest at high N
availability, leading to high values of residual soil 15N (HÖgberg,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hogberg1998}{1998}). Prior work has shown that
MDN inputs accelerate N losses from soil, particularly gaseous N losses
(Holtgrieve et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Holtgrieve2009}{2009}) that
are associated with large isotope fractionation (HÖgberg,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hogberg1998}{1998}). Our finding that
\(\delta^{15}N\) of soil NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} was
greater than bulk soil \(\delta^{15}N\) for 95\% of observations on the
salmon enhanced bank and 84\% of observations on the salmon depleted
bank, further confirms that isotopic fractionation is important at
Hansen Creek and likely elsewhere.

There is a global trend for higher foliar \(\delta^{15}N\) with
increased soil N supply (Craine et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Craine2009}{2009}) indicating accelerated soil N
cycling and \(\delta^{15}N\) fractionation due to exogenous N (from
salmon or elsewhere) will alter plant foliar \(\delta^{15}N\). This has
important implications for using two-source mixing models to assess
salmon N subsidies to riparian forests. Typical MDN mixing models assume
1) the isotopic signature of salmon is unchanged in the soils prior to
plant uptake, and 2) reference sites are biogeochemically similar to
salmon sites. However, our data suggest that both of these assumptions
are violated at Hansen Creek, and are likely violated at all
salmon-influenced riparian ecosystems. First, we observed that
\(\delta^{15}N\) of NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}, the dominant
form of inorganic N in our soils, exceeded the 12.6‰ salmon end-member
for 26\% of our observations from the salmon enriched bank and 9\% of
observations from the salmon depleted bank, thus violating assumption
(1) above. Our soil N data indicate Hansen Creek is a site of
intermediate fertility relative to other boreal forests, so that soil
NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} (rather than organic N or
NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}) is most likely the dominant N
source taken up by plants (I. Chapin F. Stuart et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chapin2011}{2011}). Second,
{[}N\textsubscript{Org}{]}, C:N, \(\delta^{13}C\), and GW varied with
distance from the stream independent of salmon enhancement indicating
site variability is a dominant driver of N cycling in this system. This
presents a challenge for selecting control sites to calculate
terrestrial end members, as key N cycling factors vary longitudinally
away from streams and simply selecting reference sites that are beyond
the reach of salmon would likely violate the mixing model assumption of
biogeochemical similarity. Additionally, observations of
\(\delta^{13}C\) increasing and GW decreasing from the creek edge are
consistent with higher water use efficiency and less 13C discrimination
by vegetation, resulting in higher \(\delta^{13}C\) in soil due to
litterfall (Oltean, Comeau, \& White,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Oltean2016}{2016}). These data identify
systematic differences between salmon-enhanced vs.~salmon-depleted banks
that cannot be attributed to salmon, and which likely reflect landscape
or soil differences. Previous studies examining contributions of MDN to
riparian vegetation have not tested biogeochemical similarity across
sites, an assumption that is likely violated beyond Hansen Creek
specifically.

Violation of mixing model assumptions can lead to significant bias in
calculations of MDN sources. To illustrate this point, we applied a
typical mixing model framework to our maximum observed \(\delta^{15}N\)
of NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} values to calculate the
percent MDN contribution of salmon to
NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} for the most extreme observation,
representing the greatest possible bias in calculations. Assuming soil
processes have no effect on the isotopic signature yielded impossible
result of 298\% MDN contribution. To account for isotopic fractionation
in soils, we applied our mean observed \(\delta^{15}N\) of soil
NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} at the 3 m distance (19.25‰) as
the marine endmember to mean foliar 15N data at the same site from
Quinn et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}) and estimate
59.24\% MDN on the salmon bank, which is 27.6\% lower than the original
estimate of 86.8\% using salmon \(\delta^{15}N\) as the marine
endmember. Repeating this with our maximum observed value for
\(\delta^{15}N\) of NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} (41.2‰), we
estimate only 28.9\% of foliar N on salmon enhanced bank was MDN (a
57.9\% reduction from Quinn et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}) estimates). Thus, failure to
account for isotopic enrichment associated with soil N transformations
can lead to overestimates of MDN contributions to plants, and observed
variability in \(\delta^{15}N\) of
NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} can produce a wide range of MDN
estimates not previously considered. Given that our elevated
\(\delta^{15}N\) of NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+} values are
consistent with expected changes during soil N transformation (HÖgberg,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hogberg1998}{1998}), there is a distinct
possibility that previous MDN studies have overestimated the amount of
MDN by not considering the effects of
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N fractionation in mixing
model calculations. Wheeler \& Kavanagh
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wheeler2017}{2017}) found similar results in a
semi-arid ecosystem of central Idaho, where accounting for fractionation
from decomposition resulted in a 16\% reduction in estimated N
deposition rates from salmon carcasses. The effects of fractionation on
soil N pools is occurring in both of these systems, and likely
elsewhere, and needs to be considered when applying mixing models to MDN
data to avoid overestimations of salmon N contributions to riparian
systems.

Our study is comprehensive in terms of the number of ecosystems factors
considered but limited in that it includes only one seasonal timeframe.
As much as 40\% of the annual inorganic N flux is released during the
eight-month dormant season (September-May) and it has been posited
spring and fall may be important for many biogeochemical processes in
boreal forests (F. S. Chapin, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Chapin2006}{2006};
Drake et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Drake2006}{2006}; Hobbie \& Chapin,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hobbie1996}{1996}). While MDN inputs do not
affect the N pools and transformation rates during the summer growth
period based on our results, N concentrations and transformations may be
elevated in this system on shorter timescales (weeks to months after
salmon return). The objective of this study was to identify the
long-term legacy of salmon subsidies; short-term effects were both
beyond the scope of this study and have been previously investigated in
this system (Holtgrieve et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Holtgrieve2009}{2009}). Considering long-term
effect of N subsidies as opposed to short-term provides new information
on sustained N use and retention in the ecosystem and whether these
salmon nutrients have lasting impacts on ecosystem function meaningful
in a restoration context.

While this study is limited to one system, the results that N
transformations cause a fractionation that can bias MDN mixing model
estimates and that landscape factors are the primary driver of long-term
N retention and use, are relevant to other systems where anadromous,
semelparous salmon are abundant (Pacific, Atlantic, Great Lakes) (Quinn
et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}). This result also
agrees with related research examining fractionation of mineralization
and nitrification (HÖgberg, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hogberg1998}{1998}),
and fertilization studies (Lu et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lu2011}{2011}). Additionally, it demonstrates
salmon N subsidies may have a short-term and likely small spatial scale
(Drake et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Drake2006}{2006}) legacy in soils.
While the importance of site variability relative to salmon subsidies
may vary by system, this work demonstrates the importance of considering
site variability and demonstrating biogeochemical similarity when
selecting control sites for riparian MDN studies.

Salmon provide critical food resources to many of terrestrial and
aquatic consumers (C. Jeff Cederholm, Kunze, Murota, \& Sibatani,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Cederholm1999}{1999}; Schindler et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Schindler2003}{2003}; Scott M et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gende2002}{2002}), but the evidence that MDN
stimulate terrestrial primary production is less certain. The salmon
carcass manipulation experiment described here and in Quinn et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}) represents an extreme case of
carcass addition and depletion to riparian areas, as measured by bulk
\(\delta^{15}N\) and estimated percent contribution was approximately
twice previous studies for both trees and soils (Bartz \& Naiman,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bartz2005}{2005}; Helfield \& Naiman,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Helfield2002}{2002}). Generally, results of this
manipulation were equivocal for soils and a statistically significant
but ecologically small effect on trees (Quinn et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quinn2018}{2018}). Simultaneously, other recent
changes to boreal forest systems, such as moisture and temperature,
appear to have a greater potential than MDN to alter biogeochemical
pathways and primary production in these systems (F. S. Chapin,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chapin2006}{2006}; Lloyd, Duffy, \& Mann,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lloyd2013}{2013}; M. Wright et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wright2018}{2018}; Yarie,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Yarie2008}{2008}). This study also demonstrates
the importance of testing biogeochemical and site similarity between
experimental and control sites in nutrient subsidy studies, as even
banks on the same creek can have landscape and soil variability that
alter N concentration, transformations, and vegetative growth.
Altogether, while salmon have clear benefits for consumers, management
of salmon populations or application of compensatory restoration
strategies based on terrestrial productivity response to salmon inputs
may be unfounded for some systems, and at least, hard to predict.

food web-assimilated carbon and nitrogen resources to a century of
environmental
change}\label{stable-isotope-signatures-in-historic-harbor-seal-bone-link-food-web-assimilated-carbon-and-nitrogen-resources-to-a-century-of-environmental-change}

\section{Abstract}\label{abstract-1}

Anthropogenic climate change will impact nutrient cycles, primary
production, and ecosystem structure in the world's oceans, although
considerable uncertainty exists regarding the magnitude and spatial
variability of these changes. Understanding how regional-scale ocean
conditions control nutrient availability and ultimately nutrient
assimilation into food webs will inform how marine resources will change
in response to climate. To evaluate how ocean conditions influence the
assimilation of nitrogen and carbon into coastal marine food webs, we
applied a novel dimension reduction analysis to a century of newly
acquired molecular isotope data derived from historic harbor seal bone
specimens. By measuring bulk \(\delta^{13}C\) and \(\delta^{15}N\)
values of source amino acids of these top predators from 1928-2014, we
derive indices of primary production and nitrogen resources that are
assimilated into food webs. We determined coastal food webs responded to
climate regimes, coastal upwelling, and freshwater discharge, yet the
strength of responses to individual drivers varied across the northeast
Pacific. Indices of primary production and nitrogen availability in the
Gulf of Alaska were dependent on regional climate indices (i.e., North
Pacific Gyre Oscillation) and upwelling. In contrast, the coastal
Washington and Salish Sea food webs were associated with local indices
of freshwater discharge. For some regions (eastern Bering Sea, northern
Gulf of Alaska) food web assimilated production was coupled with
nitrogen sources, however other regions demonstrated no
production-nitrogen coupling (Salish Sea). Temporal patterns of
environmental indices and isotopic data from Washington state varied
about the long-term mean with no directional trend. Data from the Gulf
of Alaska, however, showed below average harbor seal \(\delta^{13}C\)
values and above average ocean conditions since 1975, indicating a
change in primary production in recent decades. Altogether, these
findings demonstrate stable isotope data can provide useful indices of
nitrogen resources and phytoplankton dynamics specific to what is
assimilated by food webs.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-2}

Changing ocean conditions are reshaping the structure and function of
marine food webs on regional scales. Ocean temperature (Hoegh-Guldberg
\& Bruno, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hoegh2010}{2010}), oxygen availability
(Breitburg et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Brietburg2018}{2018}), and
climatic regimes such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Vecchi \&
Wittenberg, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Vecchi2010}{2010}) alter nutrient
availability and cycling, and thus, the ecological structure of marine
systems. Projected global redistribution of nutrients suggests net
primary production in the ocean is likely to change both spatially and
temporally. Yet, substantial uncertainty remains, with predictions
suggesting both increases and decreases in global net primary
productivity of up to 20\% by 2100 (L. Bopp et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bopp2013}{2013}; Gregg, Conkright, Ginoux,
O'Reilly, \& Casey, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Gregg2003}{2003}; Kwiatkowski
et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kwiatkowski2017}{2017}). An important
contributor to this uncertainty is regional variability in phytoplankton
response to ocean conditions and how that variability will impact other
trophic levels and dependent fisheries (Brander,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Brander2010}{2010}; J. K. Moore et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Moore2018}{2018}). Ocean conditions (i.e., sea
surface temperature, freshwater discharge, wind, and ice cover) have
been associated with abundance and recruitment of many fish species in
the Northeast Pacific (Cunningham, Westley, \& Adkison,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Cunningham2018}{2018}; Puerta, Ciannelli,
Rykaczewski, Opiekun, \& Litzow,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Puerta2019}{2019}; Stachura et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Stachura2014}{2014}). Nonetheless, these studies
rarely include indicators of nutrient availability or primary production
linking the ecosystem response to its environment. Understanding how
regional and local scale physical drivers control nutrient availability
and ultimately nutrient assimilation into food webs will be important
for predicting the future availability of marine resources.

A strong empirical understanding of food web response to changing ocean
conditions and nutrient constraints requires time series data that span
multiple climate regimes to decouple natural variability with long-term
anthropogenic changes. Currently, quantitative methods are also limited
in their ability to scale primary production trends to ecosystem-level
responses. Stable isotope measures of \(\delta^{15}N\)
(\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N) of individual amino acids
is an emerging tool for reconstructing trends in nitrogen sources from
historic specimens (McMahon et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-McMahon2019}{2019}; Sherwood, Guilderson,
Batista, Schiff, \& McCarthy,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sherwood2014}{2014}; Sherwood, Lehmann, Schubert,
Scott, \& McCarthy, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Sherwood2011}{2011}; Whitney,
Johnson, Dostie, Luzier, \& Wanamaker,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Whitney2019}{2019}). The \(\delta^{15}N\)
signature at the base of the food web is primarily controlled by
utilization and the isotopic signatures of different nitrogen sources,
particularly urea, nitrate, and ammonium, by primary producers (N.
Ohkouchi et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Ohkouchi2017}{2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Graham2010}{2009}). Measurements of bulk
\(\delta^{15}N\) values from consumers can be difficult to attribute to
changes at the base of the food web because trophic level shifts also
effect the isotopic composition of bulk nitrogen (Fry,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Fry2006}{2006}). Amino acid specific
\(\delta^{15}N\) data addresses this challenge, as amino acids exhibit
two distinct patterns in isotopic enrichment: trophic amino acids (i.e.,
glutamic acid, alanine, proline) become enriched in \(\delta^{15}N\)
with each trophic transfer and source amino acids (i.e., phenylalanine,
lysine, methionine) show minimal change and thus are reflective of the
base of the food web (Chikaraishi et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chikaraishi2009}{2009}; McClelland \& Montoya,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-McClelland2002}{2002}; N. Ohkouchi et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ohkouchi2017}{2017}).

Similar to the nitrogen stable isotope composition of amino acids as a
proxy for nitrogen sources, carbon isotopic composition has emerged as a
useful tool for assessing historic changes in phytoplankton (Lorrain et
al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lorrain2020}{2020}; McMahon et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-McMahon2019}{2019}). However, cellular growth
rates, phytoplankton community composition, the isotopic composition of
carbon in CO\textsubscript{2}, and CO\textsubscript{2} concentration all
affect the \(\delta^{13}C\)
(\textsuperscript{13}C/\textsuperscript{12}C) values of phytoplankton in
tandem (Burkhardt, Riebesell, \& Zondervan,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Burkhardt1999}{1999}; Lorrain et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lorrain2020}{2020}). The relative effects of
these factors remain difficult to discern from carbon isotope data
alone. Nonetheless, carbon stable isotope data is highly correlated with
copepod biomass in the northeast Pacific and thus can be a useful
combined index of ocean productivity (Espinasse, Hunt, Batten, Pakhomov,
\& Tittensor, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Espinasse2020}{2020}). While both
source amino acid \(\delta^{15}N\) and bulk \(\delta^{13}C\) values can
be influenced by a number of biogeochemical and physiological processes
(Figure 2.1), they are useful indicators of nitrogen utilization (source
amino acid \(\delta^{15}N\)) and phytoplankton dynamics (bulk
\(\delta^{13}C\)), despite the difficulty in identifying specific
mechanisms of fractionation.

Here we use source amino acid \(\delta^{15}N\) and bulk \(\delta^{13}C\)
values of consumer bone collagen as indicators of change in food
web-assimilated nitrogen (nitrogen utilization and isotopic composition
at the base of the food web) and food web-assimilated production
(phytoplankton composition, {[}CO\textsubscript{2}{]}, cellular growth,
and physiology). These definitions assume major changes in nitrogen
utilization and phytoplankton dynamics are recorded in the stable
isotope composition of nitrogen and carbon in phytoplankton (McMahon et
al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-McMahon2019}{2019}; N. Ohkouchi et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ohkouchi2017}{2017}; Sherwood et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sherwood2011}{2011}; Vega et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-delaVega2021}{2021}), scaled to the spatial and
temporal resource use of consumers, and conserved with minimal trophic
fractionation (Chikaraishi et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chikaraishi2009}{2009}). Bulk \(\delta^{13}C\)
and \(\delta^{15}N\) values of source amino acids such as phenylalanine
(\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\)) from long-lived, generalist consumers provide
ecosystem-level information of carbon and nitrogen dynamics that are
integrated over space, time, and multiple energy pathways in the food
web (McCann, Rasmussen, \& Umbanhowar,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-McCann2005}{2005}; Vega et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-delaVega2021}{2021}). As a result, these data
sources are more relevant to questions of food web responses to
large-scale environmental forcing than discrete measurements of
inorganic nutrients or phytoplankton. Ultimately these data can be used
to understand how ecosystems have responded to environmental variability
in the past and glean insights into food web responses to oceanic
conditions in the future.

Harbor seals (\emph{Phoca vitulina}) are a particularly well-suited
predator to understand food web shifts through time because of their
primarily piscivorous diet, generalist foraging strategies, high site
fidelity, and frequent occurrence in museum specimen collections. Adult
harbor seals typically forage 5 - 10 km from haul out sites and at
depths \textless{} 200 m and are opportunistic feeders (Lance, Chang,
Jeffries, Pearson, \& Acevedo-Gutiérrez,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lance2012}{2012}). Therefore, the nitrogen and
carbon stable isotope composition of harbor seals offer a robust
representation of the isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen
assimilated into coastal food webs. Harbor seal specific trophic
enrichment factors for nitrogen have been quantified in controlled
feeding studies, confirming minimal trophic enrichment for phenylalanine
between seals and their prey (Germain, Koch, Harvey, \& McCarthy,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Germain2013}{2013}). Environmentally induced
shifts in foraging patterns, specifically nearshore verse offshore
feeding, has the potential to affect the carbon isotope composition in
harbor seal tissues (Figure 2.1). We assume these behavioral effects are
minimal on annual time scales compared to changes in the carbon and
nitrogen isotope composition at the base of the food web given their
restricted foraging ranges.

We aim to identify how archived \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and bulk
\(\delta^{13}C\) values vary regionally across the northeast Pacific on
ecologically relevant scales (integrated annually and regionally) and
through time using museum harbor seal specimens from 1928-2014 (Figure
\ref{fig:map}). Additionally, we characterize abiotic factors that
influence harbor seal \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and bulk \(\delta^{13}C\)
values to identify ocean conditions important for food web assimilation
of nitrogen and carbon. The effect of regional ocean condition on the
stable isotope signature of source amino acids limits the application of
short-term datasets for productivity studies, as short-term
environmental perturbations are difficult to decouple from longer term
trends such as climate regimes (Vokhshoori \& McCarthy,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Vokshoori2014}{2014}). We therefore identify
long-term environmental drivers that are important for interpreting
reconstructed isotope data.

\section{Methods}\label{methods-1}

\subsection{Sample Collection and
Analysis}\label{sample-collection-and-analysis}

Harbor seal bone samples were obtained from specimens curated at the
Burke Museum (University of Washington), the Slater Museum (University
of Puget Sound), the Museum of the North (University of Alaska
Fairbanks), the Royal British Columbia Museum, the Smithsonian
Institute, and the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NOAA). Specimens
were either treated by maceration in warm water or cleaned by beetles
and soaked in a dilute ammonia solution then stored in acid free boxes.
Adult specimens were sampled from three regions: eastern Bering Sea, the
Gulf of Alaska, and Washington state, which also included 18 specimens
from the southern British Columbia coast (Figure \ref{fig:map}). We
further stratified samples from the Gulf of Alaska into two subregions
(northern and southeast) and Washington state into two subregions
(coastal and Salish Sea) for a total of five subregions. Sampling
prioritized long-term temporal coverage, specifically focusing on
climate regimes shifts (i.e., PDO). Additionally, samples with sex and
size metadata were prioritized, although it was not available for most
specimens. Metadata was accessed through
\href{http://www.vertnet.org/index.html}{VertNet} using catalogue
numbers and institution codes.

Bone samples were decalcified with the resulting collagen acid
hydrolyzed, derivatized, and analyzed for compound-specific nitrogen
stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of 11 individual amino acids, including
one source amino acid, phenylalanine (phe). Of the 11 amino acids,
phenylalanine was the only discernable source amino acid and
phenylalanine is the only amino acid data are reported in this
manuscript (Appendix S1). CSIA samples were analyzed by GC-C-irMS at the
University of Washington Facility for Compound-Specific Stable Isotope
Analysis of Environmental Samples using a Thermo Scientific Trace GC +
GC IsoLink coupled to a Delta V irMS following the procedures developed
by Y. Chikaraishi, Kashiyama, Ogawa, Kitazato, \& Ohkouchi
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chikaraishi2007}{2007}) and protocols by Rachel
Jeffrey's lab at University of Liverpool UK (full analytical details are
provided in Appendix 1). Individual collagen samples were analyzed in
triplicate along with a mixed amino acid standard of known isotopic
composition (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) (mean precision of analytical standard
for phenylalanine = 0.3‰). Internal and external standards were used and
data processing included a drift correction. A total of 215 specimens
were sampled from the time period of 1928-2014 for CSIA, making this the
largest CSIA dataset of a mammal to date. Decalcified collagen of 190
specimens was analyzed for bulk
\textsuperscript{13}C/\textsuperscript{12}C and bulk
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N at the University of
Washington's IsoLab using a Costech ElementalAnalyzer, ConFlo III,
MAT253 for continuous flow-based measurements.
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N and
\textsuperscript{13}C/\textsuperscript{12}C are reported in standard
delta notation:
\begin{equation} 
  \delta^{15}N_ ( \textperthousand vs. air) =   
  [(\frac{^{15}N/^{14}N_{Sample}}{^{15}N/^{14}N_{Air}} -1)*1000]
  \label{eq:deltN}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
  \delta^{13}C_ ( \textperthousand vs. VPBD) =   
  [(\frac{^{13}C/^{13}C_{Sample}}{^{13}C/^{13}C_{VPBD}} -1)*1000]
  \label{eq:deltC}
\end{equation}
Internal laboratory standards (Bristol Bay salmon and glutamic acid)
were interspersed with samples for a two-point calibration and blank
correction (mean standard precision 0.09‰ for \(\delta^{15}N\) and 0.04‰
for \(\delta^{13}C\)). A linear drift correction was also applied using
IsoDat software. The collagen C:N ratio was used to verify the integrity
of collagen for stable isotope analysis following specimen treatment and
storage (Klinken, \protect\hyperlink{ref-vanKlinken1999}{1999}).

The isotopic composition of marine dissolved organic carbon has been
steadily depleted in \textsuperscript{13}C over the past 100 years due
to increases in anthropogenic CO\_2 in the atmosphere (referred to as
the Oceanic Seuss Effect) (P. D. Quay, Tilbrook, \& Wong,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quay1992}{1992}). \(\delta^{13}C\) data were
therefore corrected for the Seuss Effect using the following equation
(Misarti, Finney, Maschner, \& Wooller,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Misarti2009}{2009}):
\begin{equation} 
 \mbox {Seuss Effect Correction Factor} =   
  d * e^{0.027*(t-1850)}
  \label{eq:seuss}
\end{equation}
Where \emph{d} is the maximum annual rate of \(\delta^{13}C\) decrease
specific to the North Pacific (-0.014 derived from P. D. Quay et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quay1992}{1992})), \emph{t} is the year
represented by the year of specimen collection with a one-year lag. The
Seuss effect varies regionally (Tagliabue \& Bopp,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tagliabue2008}{2008}) and we applied a northeast
Pacific parameterization (Misarti et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Misarti2009}{2009}).

Standard linear models were used to identify whether size (standard
length, cm), sex, and subregion of the harbor seals sampled were related
to isotopic composition and to test whether these parameters needed to
be standardized in environmental models. \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and
\(\delta^{13}C\) values were modelled independently as univariate
continuous response variables using the following equation:
\begin{equation} 
 y_i \sim N(\boldsymbol{\alpha} + \boldsymbol{\beta X}_i, \sigma^2_y)
  \label{eq:linmods}
\end{equation}
where \emph{y} is the mean triplicate value for each individual \emph{i}
for either \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) or \(\delta^{13}C\) values. \textbf{X}
represents the matrix of predictors (sex, length, subregion),
\(\boldsymbol{\alpha}\) is a scalar and \(\boldsymbol{\beta}\) is a
vector of coefficients for the predictors. Length (n = 116) was modelled
as a continuous variable and was natural log transformed; subregion and
sex (n = 190) were modelled as factors. Individual models were used to
test whether a predictor was significant as opposed to a multivariate
framework because, 1) sample sizes for \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) (n = 215)
and \(\delta^{13}C\) (n = 190) data varied, and 2) predictor metadata
was incomplete for specimens. A pairwise t-test using the Bonferroni
correction and non-pooled standard deviation was also used to compare
differences in mean isotope signature between subregions and sex (Figure
\ref{fig:dist}, Tables \ref{tab:ttestN} \& \ref{tab:ttestC}).

To understand the extent of coupling between indices of food web
assimilated production and nitrogen resources, a linear model
representing the basin wide relationship was fit to
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and \(\delta^{13}C\) values as continuous
variables assuming normal errors. To understand spatial variation in
this relationship, a hierarchical model was fit to the same dataset with
varying slope and varying intercept based on subregion as a random
effect. This model took the following form:
\begin{equation} 
 y_i \sim N(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{j[i]} + \boldsymbol{\beta}_{j[i]}\boldsymbol{x}_i, \sigma^2_y)
  \label{eq:hiermods}
\end{equation}
Where \emph{y} represents \(\delta^{13}C\) values as a continuous
variable and x represents \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values as a continuous
variable and j represents the group level predictor, subregion.
\(\boldsymbol{\alpha}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\beta}\) are each vectors of
coefficients that vary by subregion.

\subsection{Quantifying effects of ocean condition on food web isotope
indices}\label{quantifying-effects-of-ocean-condition-on-food-web-isotope-indices}

Linear models were used to identify environmental drivers of
\(\delta^{13}C\) and \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values using a suite of
environmental indices as covariates. A total of 42 environmental time
series were compiled as potential predictor variables (Table 2.2) based
on previous evidence for food web importance in the northeast Pacific
(Di Lorenzo et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-DiLorenzo2008}{2008};
Stachura et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Stachura2014}{2014}). Each
environmental time series was standardized around a mean of 0 and
standard deviation of 1 and discharge data was also natural log
transformed. We divided these environmental covariates a priori into
four main mechanistic properties based on the expected effect on
nutrient assimilation into the food web: climate regime, freshwater
discharge, circulation (wind and upwelling), and sea surface temperature
(Figure 2.1). Given the three regions in our analysis, each of these
hypotheses were also divided according to our regional geographic breaks
(eastern Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, and Washington). To reduce
collinearity between environmental time series and reduce the total
number of candidate models, a subset of 7 environmental times series
were selected for each region based on the temporal overlap with stable
isotope data. Each subset contained at least one time series for each of
the four mechanistic properties and all possible combinations of
predictors were tested (Table 2.3). While reduction of the number of
times series provides analytical benefits, it comes at the cost of
potentially conservative estimates of which covariates are important,
meaning important components of ocean condition to the food webs may be
missed.

\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and \(\delta^{13}C\) values were independently
considered as response variables to evaluate relationships between
predictors (environmental indices and location) and stable isotope data
using Figure \eqref{eq:linmods} where X is a matrix of predictors using
the 7 standardized environmental time series (continuous) and subregion
(factor) as covariates. We treated carbon and nitrogen isotopes as
response variables separately in linear models, rather than in a
combined multivariate model due to differences in sample size and
differences in the strength of correlation between for
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and \(\delta^{13}C\) values for each subregion.
Time series data prior to 1950 and after 2014 was excluded from this
analysis as data for some covariates did not extend beyond 1950.
Candidate models (n = 53) were compared using Akaike Information
Criteria with a small sample size correction {[}AICc{]} and included all
combinations of the environmental indices. In addition, a subregion
factor was included with two levels for Washington (Salish Sea and
coastal Washington) and the Gulf of Alaska (southcentral and southeast)
and a null model (intercept only) was also tested. Tissue turnover time
of bone collagen has not been measured in mammals of this size to our
knowledge but is approximately 173 days for birds (Hobson \& Clark,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hobson1992}{1992}). Thus, a lag of one year was
applied to the stable isotope datasets to account for the timing of
tissue turnover in bone collagen. To validate this approach of applying
a 1-year lag, 0- and 2-year lags were also applied to the best models of
each region an compared to the 1-year lag using AIC. Additionally, month
was tested as a smoothed predictor with 12 knots for stable isotope data
in Washington samples using a generalized additive model (GAM). Support
for a significant smoothing term would identify and seasonality in the
data, which would be expected if tissue turnover time is less than a
year. A one-year tissue turnover time was confirmed as a suitable
assumption for harbor seal bone collagen, as 0- and 2- year lags had
similar or less model support. There was no support for a smoothing
effect by month in generalized additive models of \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\)
and \(\delta^{13}C\) which would have indicated any seasonal variability
in isotope composition and thus a turnover time of less than or greater
than a year (p \textless{} 0.05; Figure \ref{fig:Length}) and thus a
1-year lag was applied to isotope data for all temporal analyses.

For each model with relatively high support (ΔAICc \textless{} 2) the
AICc weight and the coefficient for each covariate is reported (Figure
\ref{fig:dist}. To confirm collinearity was not problematic in the
candidate models that included more than one environmental covariate,
matrix scatterplots and variance inflation factors (vif) were used from
the car package (Fox et al. 2019) in R (R Development Core Team, 2020).

\subsection{Gaussian Process Dynamic Factor Analysis
(GPDFA)}\label{gaussian-process-dynamic-factor-analysis-gpdfa}

To further understand how the environment, \(\delta^{13}C\), and
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values covary through time in the Northeast
Pacific, we developed a novel extension of conventional Dynamic Factor
Analysis (DFA). DFA is a dimension reduction technique that identifies
common processes underlying a set of multivariate time series. This
technique has been applied to multivariate time series problems in
fisheries and ecology to identify patterns of oceanographic variability
that drive Pacific salmon stocks (Jorgensen, Ward, Scheuerell, \& Zabel,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jorgensen2016}{2016}; Ohlberger, Scheuerell,
Schindler, \& Peters, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Ohlberger2016}{2016};
Stachura et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Stachura2014}{2014}).

DFA models identify common trends across multiple time series (``latent
trends'') and estimates the importance of that trend for each individual
time series as a coefficient (``factor loading''). The two equations
describing DFA take on the following form:
\begin{equation} 
 \boldsymbol{y}_t = \boldsymbol{Zx}_t + \boldsymbol{v}_t,\mbox{ where }\boldsymbol{v}_t \sim MVN(0,\boldsymbol{R})
  \label{eq:gdfa1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
 \boldsymbol{x}_t = \boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} + \boldsymbol{w}_t,\mbox{ where }\boldsymbol{w}_t \sim MVN(0,\boldsymbol{I})
  \label{eq:gdfa2}
\end{equation}
The observed data \textbf{y}\textsubscript{t} are modeled as
combinations of latent trends \textbf{x}\textsubscript{t} at time
\emph{t} (the dimensions of \textbf{x}\textsubscript{t} matching the
number of trends which are also referred to as states) and factor
loadings (\textbf{Z}) (a coefficient for each time series for each
trend) at time \emph{t}, which are modeled as a random walk (Zuur et al.
2003). In addition there is an optional random observation error
(\textbf{v}\textsubscript{t}) and process error
(\textbf{w}\textsubscript{t}) which are multivariate normal

Our extension of DFA adopts an alternative model of the latent trends,
modeling them with Gaussian Processes rather than random walks.Gaussian
Processes (GP) have been widely used in fisheries and other fields
(Munch, Giron‐Nava, \& Sugihara,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Munch2018}{2018}). Instead of modeling a time
series as an autoregressive process, GPs model a time series via a mean
and variance function, \emph{x\textasciitilde{}}\(MVN(u,\Sigma)\) where
\emph{u} represents and optional mean vector and \textbf{Σ} a covariance
matrix. For GPDFA, we assume the mean to be zero, letting just the
covariance function determine the GP smoothing. GPs are flexible in that
the covariance matrix can be described by a wide range of flexible
functions; for this application we use a Gaussian kernel (squared
exponential) so that \(\Sigma_{i,j}=\sigma^2 exp(-d_{i,j}/\sigma)\),
where \(\sigma^2\) is a variance parameter controlling the magnitude, θ
is a shape parameter controlling how quickly covariance declines, and
\(d_{i,j}\) is the known distance between time points \emph{i} and
\emph{j}. A benefit of modeling \textbf{Σ} with a covariance function is
that regardless of the dimensionality, all elements of \textbf{Σ} can be
described by a small number of parameters. For GPDFA, we choose to use a
GP predictive process model, because the number of time points may be
large (Latimer, Banerjee, Sang Jr, Mosher, \& Silander Jr,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Latimer2009}{2009}). This predictive model
estimates the function values at a subset of locations (knots), and
combines these estimates with the distance to locations at which data
are observed to make predictions. More specifically, the values of the
time series at the knot locations are
\(x^*\)\textasciitilde{}\(MVN(0,\Sigma^*)\). Given the known distances
between the locations of knots and locations of data, the covariance
matrix between the two can be calculated, \(\Sigma_{(x,x^*)}\). Finally,
the predictions of the time series at the observed data can be
calculated as \(\hat{x}=\Sigma'_{(x,x^*)}\Sigma^{*-1}x^*\). In this
extension of DFA, all other model components are identical to the
conventional time series version with latent trends modeled as a random
walk.

With the Gaussian Process DFA model, a decision needs to be made a
priori about selecting the number and location of knots, where the
function parameters are estimated at. There are multiple approaches for
doing this; we adopted a model with 15 knots (more knots resulting in a
smoother function), and estimated the knot location by performing a
clustering approach of the years corresponding to the raw observations
(partitioning around medoids, using the `pamk' function in the fpc
library in R).

With conventional DFA using an autoregressive model, long gaps in time
series data result in large, overestimations of the variance of the
latent trends. Gaussian Processes model time series as a multivariate
normal distribution, with estimated mean vector \textbf{u} and
covariance matrix \textbf{Σ} (Munch et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Munch2018}{2018}). To constrain the number of
estimated parameters, elements of \textbf{Σ} were modeled with a
Gaussian or squared covariance exponential function such that
\(\Sigma_{(i,j)}= \sigma^2 exp(-(t_i-t_j )^2/\theta)\). In this
parameterization, \(\sigma^2\) controls the variability of the
stochastic process, \(\theta\) controls the rate of decay in correlation
between time steps, and t\textsubscript{i} and t\textsubscript{j} are
the time variables (e.g.~years) for locations \emph{i} and \emph{j}.

We considered models with 1- 4 underlying trends. Each trend was
modelled separately (different means) but models with multiple trends to
have a shared covariance matrix amongst trends. The GPDFA approach was
applied to time series from each region and the best model was selected
using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOIC) from the loo package in R
(Vehtari, Gelman, \& Gabry, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Vehtari2017}{2017}).
The choice of knots affects the degree of smoothness, with more knots
creating more smooth functions. We tested several different numbers of
knots and found results to be qualitatively similar. Similar to the
previous analysis, time series data prior to 1948 for Washington state
and prior to 1940 and after 2008 for the Gulf of Alaska was excluded
from this analysis. We fit GPDFA to data from each region including all
of the initial 42 identified environmental time series for that region
(Table 2.2), \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and \(\delta^{13}C\) values, with
location as a factor. We implemented GPDFA using the Stan language (Stan
Development Team 2019, Carpenter et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Carpenter2017}{2017}), and R (R Core Development
Team 2019, version 3.6.2) via R package rstan (Stan Development Team
2019, version 2.21.2). Code to implement GPDFA is available
\href{https://github.com/mfeddern/CSIA-AA/blob/master/SourceData/Src/Analysis/gpdfa.stan}{here}

\section{Results}\label{results-1}

\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and bulk \(\delta^{13}C\) values did not vary by
sex (p \textgreater{} 0.05, Figure \ref{fig:dist} or size for the
individuals sampled (p \textgreater{} 0 .05; Figure \ref{fig:Length}).
Spatial variation in harbor seal \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and
\(\delta^{13}C\) values were observed on subregional scales.
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values were similar for harbor seals in the
northern Gulf of Alaska (11.9 ± 2.9, mean ± 1SD), southeast Gulf of
Alaska (10.8 ± 1.7), and coastal Washington (11.3 ± 1.9). The eastern
Bering Sea had significantly higher \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values
compared to other subregions (15.2 ± 1.8) followed by the Salish Sea
(12.2 ± 2.3) which had similar \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values compared to
the northern Gulf of Alaska (Figure \ref{fig:dist}, Table
\ref{tab:ttestN}). \(\delta^{13}C\) values varied by subregion (p
\textless{} 0.05) with the exception of the Gulf of Alaska, where the
northern (-14.6 ± 0.9) and southeast (-14.4 ± 1.1) subregions were not
significantly different, and the eastern Bering Sea (-13.4 ± 0.9) and
coastal Washington (-13.6 ± 0.9) were not significantly different
(Figure \ref{fig:dist}, Table \ref{tab:ttestC}). The variation between
subregions appeared to follow a latitudinal gradient, where harbor seal
mean \(\delta^{13}C\) values were most enriched in \(^{13}C\) in the
Salish Sea (-12.2 ± 1.5), became more depleted from coastal Washington
and into the Gulf of Alaska (Table \ref{tab:ranges}).

The relationship between harbor seal \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and
\(\delta^{13}C\) values also varied on subregional scales. There was
positive linear association between harbor seal \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\)
and \(\delta^{13}C\) values in the combined northeast Pacific basin and
Bering Sea model with a slope of 0.12 (Figure \ref{fig:hiermod}A). For
the hierarchical subregion model, the eastern Bering Sea and coastal
Washington demonstrated similar relationship, with slopes of 0.08 (95\%
CI {[}0.05, 0.11{]}) and 0.07 (95\% CI {[}0.05, 0.09{]}) respectively.
Similarly, harbor seals in both Gulf of Alaska subregions demonstrated
comparable coupling of \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and \(\delta^{13}C\), with
slopes of 0.13 (95\% CI {[}0.11, 0.14{]}) for the northern subregion and
0.12 (95\% CI {[}0.10, 0.14{]}) for the southeastern subregion. Salish
Sea harbor seals had a distinct relationship between
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and \(\delta^{13}C\) values relative to other
subregions with a slope of only 0.02 that was not significantly
different from 0 (95\% CI {[}0.0, 0.04{]}) (Figure \ref{fig:hiermod}B).

For both \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and \(\delta^{13}C\) values there was
substantial support for models including environmental indices rather
than null or subregion only models. The relationship between
environmental indices and harbor seal \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and
\(\delta^{13}C\) values in the northeast Pacific varied on regional
scales. For Washington, the best model to predict harbor seal
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values included Columbia River discharge in high
flow months, summer upwelling, and subregion. There was substantial
model uncertainty for \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values in the Washington
region, however 90\% of model weight supported the inclusion of Columbia
River discharge (Figure \ref{fig:coefres}A). The model for harbor seal
\(\delta^{13}C\) values with the most support indicated a positive
association between PDO, spring upwelling, and freshwater discharge in
the Washington region (Figure \ref{fig:coefres}B). In the Gulf of
Alaska, the summer upwelling model had the most support as a predictor
of harbor seal \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values with some model support for
inclusion of the NPGO (North Pacific Gyre Oscillation), although the
coefficients for this covariate did not differ substantially from 0
(Figure \ref{fig:coefres}C). The best model for harbor seal
\(\delta^{13}C\) values for the Gulf of Alaska included subregion, PDO
(Pacific Decadal Oscillation), and NPGO (Figure \ref{fig:coefres}D). In
contrast to Washington, the Gulf of Alaska models supported a negative
association between δ13C values and PDO. The null model for
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values in the eastern Bering Sea had the most
support (Figure \ref{fig:coefres}E). Lack of model support for
environmental covariates in the eastern Bering Sea may have been a
result of the small sample size in the region. Cross-shelf wind was
included as a predictor in the best model (Figure \ref{fig:coefres}F)
for \(\delta^{13}C\) values in the eastern Bering Sea and was supported
by 76\% of the model weight.

PDO and Kuskokwim river discharge during high flow months were found to
be highly collinear (VIF \textgreater{} 10) and PDO was omitted from the
candidate model set for the eastern Bering Sea analysis. All other
models containing multiple environmental predictors with relative
support had variance inflation factors of less than 2 indicating only
moderate collinearity across covariates. Model residuals for the best
models did not show trends through time (Figure \ref{fig:linresid}).
This indicates that there were no trends associated with other potential
ecosystem changes, such as harbor seal foraging strategy for example,
after accounting for ocean condition. Model results did not change when
using \(\delta^{13}C\) data that were not corrected for the regional
Seuss Effect.

The GPDFA analysis showed temporal synchronies and shared trends across
environmental conditions and stable isotope values in the northeast
Pacific. In the Gulf of Alaska, the data supported three latent trends
(Figure \ref{fig:GDFAAK}). Both \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and
\(\delta^{13}C\) values had the highest loadings for trend 1, which
showed an increase starting in 1965 until 1980 followed by the trend
oscillating at approximately 25\% above the long-term average. The
harbor seal \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values for the southeast subregion,
harbor seal \(\delta^{13}C\) values, and spring upwelling had negative
loadings on trend 1; loadings of \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values were
generally weaker relative to loadings of \(\delta^{13}C\) values. For
the other two trends (2-3), loadings were clustered by environmental
driver category. Latent trend 2 oscillated around the long-term average
and was uninformative. Trend 3 was below average starting in 1985 with
strong loadings for climate time series, spring and summer upwelling,
and discharge in high flow months (Figure \ref{fig:GDFAAK}). Annual
discharge, autumn upwelling, Oceanic Niño Index and Northern Oscillation
Index did not demonstrate strong loadings for any trend. In Washington,
there was support for two latent trends. Latent trend 1 shows a rapid
increase in the 1940's to 25\% above the long-term mean then a gradual
decline until 1986 to approximately 40\% below the long-term mean, with
values below the mean starting in 1977 (Figure \ref{fig:GDFAWA}). Trend
loadings for harbor seal \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and \(\delta^{13}C\)
values were stronger for coastal seals and trend 1 had stronger loadings
for freshwater discharge than trend 2. Trend 2 had strong loadings for
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and \(\delta^{13}C\) values for both Salish Sea
and coastal Washington harbor seals. Trend 2 oscillated above and below
the long-term mean and had large loadings for sea surface temperature,
summer upwelling, Fraser River discharge and climate indices (Figure
\ref{fig:GDFAWA}).

To validate this approach of applying a 1-year lag, 0- and 2-year lags
were also applied to the best models of each region an compared to the
1-year lag using AIC. Additionally, month was tested as a smoothed
predictor with 12 knots for stable isotope data in Washington samples
using a generalized additive model (GAM). Support for a significant
smoothing term would identify and seasonality in the data, which would
be expected if tissue turnover time is less than a year. A one-year
tissue turnover time was confirmed as a suitable assumption for harbor
seal bone collagen, as 0- and 2- year lags had similar or less model
support. There was no support for a smoothing effect by month in
generalized additive models of \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and
\(\delta^{13}C\) which would have indicated any seasonal variability in
isotope composition and thus a turnover time of less than or greater
than a year (p \textless{} 0.05; Figure \ref{fig:Length}) and thus a
1-year lag was applied to isotope data for all temporal analyses.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion-1}

We analyzed bone collagen \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and bulk
\(\delta^{13}C\) values from harbor seal museum specimens collected
between 1928 and 2014 as indices of change in food web assimilated
nitrogen and carbon. Based on previous research (Lorrain et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lorrain2020}{2020}; Sherwood et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sherwood2014}{2014}; Vega, Jeffreys, Tuerena,
Ganeshram, \& Mahaffey, \protect\hyperlink{ref-delaVega2019}{2019}), we
interpret \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and bulk \(\delta^{13}C\) values as
primarily representing nitrogen and carbon resource utilization, and
growth and community composition of primary producers at the base of the
food web. Our data show the relationship between indices of primary
production and nitrogen resources assimilated into food webs varies
regionally across the northeast Pacific. By pairing these data with
environmental time series data, we provide new insights into large scale
environmental forcing that impacts the base of the food web and is
transferred to higher trophic levels. Specifically, oceanic conditions
associated with climate regimes and upwelling explain significant
temporal variation in \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and bulk \(\delta^{13}C\)
values of coastal predators in northeast Pacific (Figure
\ref{fig:coefres}; Figure \ref{fig:linresid}). This analysis
demonstrates \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and bulk \(\delta^{13}C\) values are
useful indicators of resources assimilated by coastal food webs.

\subsection{Spatial variation in stable isotope
indices}\label{spatial-variation-in-stable-isotope-indices}

The geographically widespread association between harbor seal
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and bulk \(\delta^{13}C\) values indicates food
web assimilated primary production is coupled with nitrogen resources in
most regions of the northeast Pacific, with the Salish Sea as a notable
exception (Figure \ref{fig:hiermod}). Short-term studies in coastal
Washington showed phytoplankton respond considerably to nitrogen inputs
and are frequently nitrogen limited (Dortch \& Postel,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Dortch1989}{1989}; R. M. Kudela \& Peterson,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kudela2009}{2009}). Similarly, short term studies
of the inner Gulf of Alaska shelf demonstrated primary production is
generally nitrogen limited, and size, growth rates, and community
composition are all tightly coupled with nutrient availability (Strom,
Olson, Macri, \& Mord, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Strom2006}{2006}). A
significant relationship between bulk \(\delta^{15}N\) and
\(\delta^{13}C\) values was also observed in the tissues of some
gorgonian corals over the same time period in coastal Gulf of Alaska
(Williams, Risk, Stone, Sinclair, \& Ghaleb,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Williams2007}{2007}). Given the evidence of
nitrogen limitations and its relationship with phytoplankton growth and
community composition in these coastal environments, the association
between \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and bulk \(\delta^{13}C\) values could be
the result of nitrogen limiting growth at the base of the food web.
Alternatively, the \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and bulk \(\delta^{13}C\)
coupling could be driven by covariance with an untested environmental
variable that impacts most of the northeast Pacific but not the Salish
Sea.

The coastal Washington and the Salish Sea food webs assimilate different
nitrogen and carbon sources (Figure \ref{fig:coefres} A \& B). Salish
Sea harbor seals have higher \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and bulk
\(\delta^{13}C\) values compared to individuals on the outer coast,
which is likely due to significant contributions of intertidal producers
and the legacy of anthropogenic N in the Salish Sea food web. Intertidal
macrophytes (seagrass and algae) have similar δ13C values
(\textasciitilde{} -10‰) compared to harbor seals in the Salish Sea,
while other potential sources are much lower (i.e., marine derived
sources \textasciitilde{} -20‰, terrestrial derived sources
\textasciitilde{} -30‰) (Conway-Cranos et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Conway2015}{2015}; Howe \& Simenstad,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Howe2015}{2015}). Incorporation of intertidal
producers into the Salish Sea food web explains the difference in carbon
stable isotope signatures between Salish Sea and coastal Washington
harbor seals (\textasciitilde{}1.4‰, Figure \ref{fig:coefres}A).
However, it does not explain the higher \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values
(Figure \ref{fig:coefres}B, Table \ref{tab:ranges}). Surface nitrate was
observed to be 8‰ -- 12‰ off the coast of Washington in spring 1993 (Wu,
Calvert, \& Wong, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wu1997}{1997}) which was
exceeded by harbor seals in both coastal Washington and the Salish Sea
(Table \ref{tab:ranges}). It is likely anthropogenically derived
nitrogen sources contribute to the higher observed
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values both directly and indirectly, particularly
in the Salish Sea where harbor seal \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values were
up to 2.4‰ higher than coastal Washington seals. Wastewater treatment
facilities and agriculture runoff contribute substantial amounts
(\textasciitilde{}32\%) of nitrogen in the Salish Sea (Mohamedali et al.
2011) and are enriched in \(^{15}N\). In recent decades, Salish Sea
waters have also been characterized by low dissolved oxygen and hypoxic
events (PSEMP 2019) from human derived nitrogen loading. Anoxic
conditions are conducive to denitrification, another potential indirect
source of \(^{15}N\) from human activities in the region.

\subsection{Ocean condition and stable isotope
indices}\label{ocean-condition-and-stable-isotope-indices}

Washington state food webs exhibit environmentally induced changes in
assimilated primary production and nitrogen sources. The isotope-ocean
condition relationship in the region can be explained by introduction of
terrestrial derived nutrients and climatically induced changes in
phytoplankton community structure observed in previous studies (Du \&
Peterson, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Du2014}{2014}; R. Kudela et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kudela2008}{2008};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Du2015}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Du2015}{a}).
For example, the PDO has been associated with phytoplankton community
shifts between dinoflagellates and diatoms in the northern California
Current
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Du2015}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Du2015}{a}).
Similarly, the phytoplankton community composition is distinct in the
early (spring) upwelling season compared to the late (summer) upwelling
season (Du \& Peterson, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Du2014}{2014}). This
could explain the inversely related associations between bulk
\(\delta^{13}C\) values and summer and spring upwelling (Figure
\ref{fig:coefres}B). Shifts in phytoplankton community structure are
therefore a mechanism to explain the relationship between harbor seal
bulk \(\delta^{13}C\) values and ocean condition. In addition,
freshwater discharge explains 16\% of variation observed in both
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) and bulk \(\delta^{13}C\) values in Washington.
The Columbia River Plume introduces terrestrial derived nutrients,
including nitrogen, and has been associated with increased primary
production and fish production (R. Kudela et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kudela2008}{2008}). The covariation between
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\), bulk \(\delta^{13}C\), and discharge indicates
isotopically distinct nitrogen resources introduced by freshwater
discharge alters primary production which is then assimilated into the
Washington food web, and ultimately harbor seals.

In the eastern Bering Sea, our results suggest ice-born algae and
\(^{15}N\) enriched nitrogen from the inner shelf are important for
supporting the coastal food web. Recent evidence supports that consumer
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values reflect nitrate \(\delta^{15}N\) values in
the arctic (de la Vega et al. 2020). However, our \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\)
values from harbor seals of the eastern Bering Sea were high relative to
previous studies of summer nitrate (5 to 9‰) (Lehmann et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lehmann2005}{2005}) and plankton nitrogen isotope
signatures (6-12‰) (Smith, Henrichs, \& Rho,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Smith2002}{2002}) from the outer and mid Bering
Sea shelf. Morales et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Morales2014}{2014})
subsequently found the stable isotope composition of nitrogen in diatoms
ranged from 5-21‰ in late winter and early spring. These values also
increased in association to sea ice with a positive shoreward gradient
(Morales et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Morales2014}{2014}). The range
of sea-ice algae \(\delta^{15}N\) values observed by Morales et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Morales2014}{2014}) are consistent with our
observed \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values in harbors seals
(\ref{tab:ranges}). Furthermore, the harbor seals in this study were
located near the inner shelf in an area that has been partially covered
by sea ice from January to May during the past century (Stabeno, Bond,
\& Salo, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Stabeno2007}{2007}). Together this
indicates ice algae as a significant contributor to the coastal food
web. The disconnect between the \(\delta^{15}N\) values of offshore
nitrate (Lehmann et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lehmann2005}{2005}) and
harbor seals also highlights the problem in assuming spatially and
temporally discrete nitrate or phytoplankton measurements are
representative of resources utilized by, and assimilated into, coastal
food webs. Consumer \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) measurements by their nature
represent the N assimilated into the food web and integrated over
relatively long time scales, while discrete measurements of nitrate may
be spatially or temporally biased.

A short term (1998-2011) study of abiotic drivers in the Gulf of Alaska
found chlorophyll-a anomalies were positive when downwelling favorable
winds were low and had a negative relationship with sea level (Waite \&
Mueter, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Waite2013}{2013}). Similarly, Espinasse
et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Espinasse2020}{2020}) found
chlorophyll-a, SST, and sea level anomalies were the best predictors of
carbon and nitrogen isotope data for secondary consumers over the past
two decades. Our results agree with these studies as NPGO (an index of
sea level) is negatively associated with both harbor seal
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) (Figure \ref{fig:coefres}C) and \(\delta^{13}C\)
values (Figure \ref{fig:coefres} D) in the Gulf of Alaska. Similarly,
summer upwelling is positively associated with our
\(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values (Figure \ref{fig:coefres}C). Based on our
results, these environmentally induced changes represent long-term
ecosystem dynamics that extend beyond merely the base of the food web
and ultimately impact resources assimilated by top predators. In
addition, regional climate indices characterize nutrient and primary
production assimilated annually into the food web better than sea
surface temperature data alone. It is possible that other untested
abiotic factors such as cross-shelf exchanges via eddy propagation or
local wind stress (Waite \& Mueter,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Waite2013}{2013}) may be important to food web
assimilated nitrogen and primary production in the Gulf of Alaska.
Regardless, local variability in upwelling and basin scale indices of
sea surface height and temperature (i.e., NPGO) ultimately determine
resource assimilation in Gulf of Alaska food web in which harbor seals
forage.

By comparing consumer stable isotope values against environmental
covariates across multiple sub basins we show environmental forcing on
coastal food webs is regionally distinct. For example, climate indices
(i.e., PDO) in the Gulf of Alaska were inversely associated with food
web-assimilated primary production (Figure \ref{fig:coefres}D, Figure
\ref{fig:GDFAAK} Trend 1-2) and positively associated in Washington
(Figure \ref{fig:coefres}B, Figure \ref{fig:GDFAWA} Trends 1-2). This
agrees with previous studies where the Pacific Decadal Oscillation has
been associated with alternating salmon production in the northeast
Pacific (Mantua, Hare, Zhang, Wallace, \& Francis,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mantua1997}{1997}). In cool phase years (i.e.,
1947-1977), Washington stocks experience above average production and
Alaska stocks experience below average production. Our results show that
\(\delta^{13}C\) values for Washington and Gulf of Alaska also indicate
alternating primary production between the two regions in association
with PDO. Surprisingly, \(\delta^{13}C\) values are higher in cool phase
years for the Gulf of Alaska (Figure \ref{fig:coefres}D) and lower in
cool phase years for Washington (Figure \ref{fig:coefres}B). This
suggests there is lower phytoplankton growth in Washington and higher in
Gulf of Alaska in cool phase years. This is contrary to results of
previous studies, assuming 1) higher \(\delta^{13}C\) values represent
higher growth rates and 2) PDO is inhibiting growth at the base of the
food web and indirectly constraining higher trophic levels such as
salmon (Mantua et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Mantua1997}{1997}). It is
likely the relationship between PDO, salmon production, and
\(\delta^{13}C\) values of harbors seals is instead caused by
phytoplankton community structure constraining higher trophic levels
rather than growth.

Common temporal trends in harbor seal stable isotopes and ocean
condition empirically derived from the GPDFA analysis (Figures 6 \& 7)
show changes in biogeochemical cycling and food web-assimilated
production in recent decades that are associated with climatic
variables. Since 1975, shared trends in environmental time series and
stable isotope data in the Gulf of Alaska are above average for
temperature, discharge, and NPGO and below average for assimilated
\(\delta^{13}C\) values (as indicated by its negative loadings; Figure
\ref{fig:GDFAAK}). Trends 2 and 3 in the Gulf of Alaska (Figure
\ref{fig:GDFAAK}) show a distinct change in environmental indices
starting in 1988. Loadings on these trends were higher for environmental
indices than stable isotope data, suggesting a decoupling of
environment-food web relationship in the region starting around 1988,
which has also been observed between climate regimes and fish species
(Litzow et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Litzow2020}{2020}). This
environmental-food web decoupling was not observed in Washington (Figure
\ref{fig:GDFAWA}) in our study or others (Litzow et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Litzow2020}{2020}).

\subsection{Using stable isotopes as food web
indicators}\label{using-stable-isotopes-as-food-web-indicators}

Previous research has shown lower trophic levels are sensitive to
environmental variation in bottom-up drivers of productivity (Jennings
\& Brander, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Jennings2010}{2010};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Frank2015}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Frank2015}{b}),
but few studies have demonstrated how the impact of these changes span
entire food webs on long time scales. By applying CSSIA to museum
specimens of a generalist predators, we provide a novel piece of the
ecological puzzle not previously available. First, these data provide a
measure of changing nitrogen resources and phytoplankton dynamics that
are spatially and temporally integrated for food web resource
assimilation, rather than measuring the availability of inorganic
nutrients or lower trophic level biomass and assuming an associated food
web response. Dominant species of marine zooplankton exhibit selective
foraging, particularly when resources are highly available (Bi \&
Sommer, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bi2020}{2020}; Boersma et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Boersma2015}{2016}; Jungbluth, Selph, Lenz, \&
Goetze, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Jungbluth2017}{2017}) thus discrete
measures of resources are not necessarily representative of what is
utilized by the food web. Second, studies directly measuring primary
production are often temporally limited to short time scales and recent
decades. CSSIA of historic specimens allows for retrospective analyses
that span long time scales (McMahon et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-McMahon2019}{2019}; Sherwood et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sherwood2011}{2011}) and thus identify long-term
environmental forcing on food webs.

Despite these benefits, CSSIA (and stable isotope analysis data more
generally) is limited in its ability to discern different mechanistic
processes for isotopic enrichment in observational studies. Multiple
mechanisms of fractionation often operate in tandem (Figure 2.1) and can
be both additive and subtractive. For example, both the isotopic
composition of dissolved inorganic nitrogen sources (primarily
\(NO_3^-\), but also urea and \(NH_4^+\)) and the relative uptake of
these sources impact the isotopic composition of nitrogen in primary
producers (N. Ohkouchi et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ohkouchi2017}{2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Graham2010}{2009}). As a result, these data on
their own are limited in their ability to track exact mechanisms of
fractionation and specific biogeochemical changes through time or space.
Regardless, stable isotope signatures of nitrogen from source amino
acids and bulk carbon can be used to trace variations in nitrogen
sources at the base of the food web (Sherwood et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sherwood2014}{2014}; Vega et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-delaVega2019}{2019}) and changes in phytoplankton
dynamics (i.e., production) (Lorrain et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lorrain2020}{2020}; Vega et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-delaVega2019}{2019}) broadly. In addition, CSSIA
of carbon is also emerging as reliable proxy for phytoplankton community
composition (Larsen et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Larsen2013}{2013}).
We also assume a constant and small trophic enrichment factor for both
bulk \(\delta^{13}C\) and \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values. While trophic
enrichment in \(\delta^{13}C\) and \(\delta^{15}N_{Phe}\) values is
minimal (Bocherens \& Drucker,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bocherens2003}{2003}; Germain et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Germain2013}{2013}; Hobson, Schell, Renouf, \&
Noseworthy, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hobson1996}{1996}; N. Ohkouchi et
al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Ohkouchi2017}{2017}), and thus unlikely to
impact overall correlations between datasets, it can produce enriched
absolute isotope values and increased variation between observations,
which was not accounted for in this study. Nonetheless, ours is among a
number of supporting studies that show food webs are impacted by
changing environmental conditions in the northeast Pacific (Cunningham
et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Cunningham2018}{2018}; Puerta et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Puerta2019}{2019}; Stachura et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Stachura2014}{2014}).

Climate change will alter nutrient distributions and primary production
throughout the worlds' oceans (Kwiatkowski et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kwiatkowski2017}{2017}; Marinov, Doney, \& Lima,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Marinov2010}{2010}). Based on analysis of
historical patterns of consumer isotopic variation with environmental
forcing, we anticipate there will be region-specific spatial variability
in how primary production and its dependent food webs respond to
environmental change throughout the northeast Pacific over the next
century. As environmental conditions (i.e., sea surface temperature,
discharge, anthropogenic nitrogen) continue to change, so will resources
available to and assimilated by food webs. Given both resource
availability and community composition of resources impact the function
and stability of food webs (Narwani \& Mazumder,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Narwani2012}{2012}) it is likely that ecosystem
interactions will change in response to environmentally induced shifts
in resources. Understanding dynamics influencing food web responses to
their environment is important, as it provides information useful for
predicting climate change impacts to aquatic resources and the
communities and economies that depend on them.

\hypertarget{tables}{\section{Tables}\label{tables}}

By far the easiest way to present tables in your thesis is to store the
contents of the table in a CSV or Excel file, then read that file in to
your R Markdown document as a data frame. Then you can style the table
with the \texttt{kable} function, or functions in the
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/index.html}{kableExtra}
pacakge.

In addition to the tables that can be automatically generated from a
data frame in \textbf{R} that you saw in {[}R Markdown Basics{]} using
the \texttt{kable} function, you can also create tables using
\emph{pandoc}. (More information is available at
\url{http://pandoc.org/README.html\#tables}.) This might be useful if
you don't have values specifically stored in \textbf{R}, but you'd like
to display them in table form. Below is an example. Pay careful
attention to the alignment in the table and hyphens to create the rows
and columns. Generally I don't recommend this approach of typing the
table directly into your R Markdown document.

We can also create a link to the table by doing the following: Table
\ref{tab:inher}. If you go back to {[}Loading and exploring data{]} and
look at the \texttt{kable} table, we can create a reference to this max
delays table too: Table \ref{tab:maxdelays}. The addition of the
\texttt{(\textbackslash{}\#tab:inher)} option to the end of the table
caption allows us to then make a reference to Table
\texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(tab:label)}. Note that this reference could
appear anywhere throughout the document after the table has appeared.

\section{Figures}\label{figures-2}

If your thesis has a lot of figures, \emph{R Markdown} might behave
better for you than that other word processor. One perk is that it will
automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter. You'll
also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then
reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables
earlier. If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and
\emph{R Markdown} will automatically adjust the numbering for you. No
need for you to remember! So that you don't have to get too far into
LaTeX to do this, a couple \textbf{R} functions have been created for
you to assist. You'll see their use below.

In the \textbf{R} chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as
\texttt{uw.png} in our main directory. We then give it the caption of
``UW logo'', the label of ``uwlogo'', and specify that this is a figure.
Make note of the different \textbf{R} chunk options that are given in
the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document).
\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{knitr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{include_graphics}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{path =} \StringTok{"figure/uw.png"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=6.25in]{figure/uw} \caption{UW logo}\label{fig:uwlogo}
\end{figure}
Here is a reference to the UW logo: Figure \ref{fig:uwlogo}. Note the
use of the \texttt{fig:} code here. By naming the \textbf{R} chunk that
contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as done in
the first sentence here. We can also specify the caption for the figure
via the R chunk option \texttt{fig.cap}.

\clearpage 

Below we will investigate how to save the output of an \textbf{R} plot
and label it in a way similar to that done above. Recall the
\texttt{flights} dataset from Chapter \ref{rmd-basics}. (Note that we've
shown a different way to reference a section or chapter here.) We will
next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by
airline from Portland for 2014. Note also the use of the \texttt{scale}
parameter which is discussed on the next page.
\begin{Shaded}

A table linking these carrier codes to airline names is available at
\url{https://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/blob/master/data/airlines.csv}.

\clearpage

Next, we will explore the use of the \texttt{out.extra} chunk option,
which can be used to shrink or expand an image loaded from a file by
specifying \texttt{"scale=\ "}. Here we use the mathematical graph
stored in the ``subdivision.pdf'' file.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figure/subdivision} \caption{Subdiv. graph}\label{fig:subd}
\end{figure}
Here is a reference to this image: Figure \ref{fig:subd}. Note that
\texttt{echo=FALSE} is specified so that the \textbf{R} code is hidden
in the document.

\textbf{More Figure Stuff}

Lastly, we will explore how to rotate and enlarge figures using the
\texttt{out.extra} chunk option. (Currently this only works in the PDF
version of the book.)
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[angle=180, scale=1.1]{figure/subdivision} \caption{A Larger Figure, Flipped Upside Down}\label{fig:subd2}

\section{Footnotes and Endnotes}\label{footnotes-and-endnotes}

You might want to footnote something.\footnote{footnote text} The
footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes
work in much the same way.

\section{Cross-referencing chapters and
sections}\label{cross-referencing-chapters-and-sections}

The
\href{https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/cross-references.html}{bookdown
documentation} is an excellent source for learning how to
cross-reference in a bookdown project such as a huskydown document. Here
we only cover the most common uses for a typical thesis. If you want
something more complex or fancy, please refer to the bookdown
documentation and seek help from the developers of that package.

By default, all of your chapter and section headers will get an
auto-generated ID label For example, e.g., \texttt{\#\ Chapter\ 1} will
have an auto-generated ID \texttt{chapter-1}. Note that the ID label is
all lower case, and has no spaces. If you have any kind of punctuation
in your header, such as a colon (:), it will not appear in the ID label.
Then in your text you can reference chapter one in your Rmd file like
this: `as discussed in Chapter
\texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(chapter-1)}', which will print as `as
discussed in Chapter 1'

We strongly recommend that you to manually assign ID labels to your
chapter header to make it easy to cross-reference. For example, at the
top of the Rmd file for this chapter, you can see:

\texttt{\#\ Tables,\ Graphics,\ References,\ and\ Labels\ \{\#ref-labels\}}

The \texttt{\{\#ref-labels\}} part of this header is the ID label. It
doesn't show in the output, but is there for us to use for easy
cross-referencing, because it can be short, and we don't need to change
it elsewhere our document when we update the chapter header. We can use
this custom ID label in our Rmd document like this: `as discussed in
Chapter \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(ref-labels)}', which will print as
`as discussed in Chapter \ref{ref-labels}'. If you need to show custom
text instead of the chapter number, you use this syntax in your Rmd
document:
\texttt{see\ {[}my\ chapter\ about\ labels{]}(\#ref-labels)\ for\ more\ details}
which will appear as `see \protect\hyperlink{ref-labels}{my chapter
about labels} for more details'

To cross-reference a specific section in the same chapter, we recommend
adding a custom ID label to the section header, and using that to
cross-reference. For example, earlier in this chapter we have a section
on tables and in the Rmd file we see
\texttt{\#\#\ Tables\ \{\#tables\}}. We can cross-reference that in the
text like this `as discussed in the section on
\texttt{{[}tables{]}(\#tables)}' which will appear as `as discussed in
the above section on \protect\hyperlink{tables}{tables}'

To cross-reference a section in a different chapter we can use the ID
label from that section directly. For example, we can write in our Rmd
document
\texttt{as\ discussed\ in\ the\ section\ on\ {[}R\ code\ chunks{]}(\#r-chunks)\ in\ Chapter\ \textbackslash{}@ref(rmd-basics)}
which will appear as `as discussed in the section on
\protect\hyperlink{r-chunks}{R code chunks} in Chapter
\ref{rmd-basics}'.

If you prefer to cross-reference by the section number, we can use
custom ID labels in our Rmd document. For example, to refer to a section
in our first chapter, we can write in the Rmd document:
\texttt{as\ discussed\ in\ section\ \textbackslash{}@ref(r-chunks)\ in\ Chapter\ \textbackslash{}@ref(rmd-basics)}.
This will appear with section and chapter numbers like so: as `as
discussed in section \ref{r-chunks} in Chapter \ref{rmd-basics}'.

\section{Bibliographies}\label{bibliographies}

Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate
an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for
creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension). In
addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the
free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero. Some Zotero documentation is at
\url{http://libguides.reed.edu/citation/zotero}. In addition, a tutorial
is available from Middlebury College at
\url{http://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/}.

\emph{R Markdown} uses \emph{pandoc} (\url{http://pandoc.org/}) to build
its bibliographies. One nice caveat of this is that you won't have to do
a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To
cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography
database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede
it by the ``at'' symbol. For example, here's a reference to a book about
worrying: ({\textbf{???}}). This \texttt{Molina1994} entry appears in a
file called \texttt{thesis.bib} in the \texttt{bib} folder. This
bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX. You
can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header
in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the \texttt{bib}
folder.

For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see
(\url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html})\footnote{({\textbf{???}})}.
There are three pages on this topic: \emph{bibtex} (which talks about
using BibTeX, at \url{http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html}),

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your
  bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better.
\item
  The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other
  entries.
\item
  When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate
  each author's name by the word ``and'' e.g.
  \texttt{Author\ =\ \{Noble,\ Sam\ and\ Youngberg,\ Jessica\},}.
\item
  Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager)
  accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as
  necessary.
\item
  To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is
  generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.

\chapter{Recent divergent changes in Alaskan pinniped trophic position
detected using compound-specific stable isotope
analysis}\label{recent-divergent-changes-in-alaskan-pinniped-trophic-position-detected-using-compound-specific-stable-isotope-analysis}

\section{Abstract}\label{abstract-2}

Over the past century Alaskan pinnipeds have experienced dramatic
changes in abundance, but these changes have been highly variable across
species and region. In recent decades, changes in atmospheric forcing
and sea surface temperature have been particularly pronounced in the
Gulf of Alaska and eastern Bering Sea, impacting the food webs in which
Alaskan pinnipeds forage. We used compound-specific stable isotope
analysis of nitrogen in amino acids to estimate historic and modern
trophic position of harbor seals and Steller sea lions in the Gulf of
Alaska and Bristol Bay. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical framework to
determine whether shared trends through time exist across pinnipeds
(classified by species and region) on decadal scales. Model results
identified both shared trends through time and classification-specific
decadal changes in pinniped trophic position. The largest change in
trophic position occurred in the 2000s and 2010s and was observed in
both Steller sea lions and harbor seals in the Gulf of Alaska, but not
harbor seals in Bristol Bay or Iliamna Lake. Divergent trophic position
patterns in the 2000s were identified in the western stock of Steller
sea lions, which increased in trophic position, and sympatric harbor
seals in the northern Gulf of Alaska, which decreased in trophic
position. Our results indicate that these species have begun exploiting
distinct trophic niches or experiencing unique food web conditions in
recent decades in the Gulf of Alaska, likely in response to recent
climate-induced ecological change in the region.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-3}

Over the past century, pinniped populations in the northeast Pacific
Ocean have experienced changes in adult and pup abundances
({\textbf{???}}). Understanding specific drivers of these population
trends is important for management, as multiple stocks have been listed
as threatened or endangered over the past two decades ({\textbf{???}}).
The observed population dynamics have also corresponded with shifts in
both the physical and ecological marine environment, which frequently
occur simultaneously. As a result, disentangling drivers of population
trends is complex, as multiple factors (environmental conditions, prey
availability, anthropogenic disturbances) can change in tandem and
potentially act synergistically on pinniped populations.

Data on long-term trends in trophic position across regions, species,
and populations is one potential way to assess how food web changes have
impacted pinnipeds in Alaska. This approach can identify how broad
shifts in foraging ecology correspond to changes in abundance and
population dynamics. More specifically, examining trophic position
during periods of declining versus increasing predator abundance can
provide insight into whether foraging behavior and prey availability are
important drivers of population dynamics. In this study, we aim to
identify whether common temporal trends in trophic ecology exist across
harbor seals (\emph{Phoca vitulina}) and Steller sea lions
(\emph{Eumetopias jubatus}) and their locations by deriving 70-years of
trophic position data from compound-specific stable isotope analysis
(CSIA) of museum specimens.

Following climatic changes in the 1970s that altered ocean currents and
sea surface temperature ({\textbf{???}}), most Gulf of Alaska and Bering
Sea pinniped populations experienced declines that persisted through the
1990s ({\textbf{???}}). However, these responses differed across
populations and species. For example, the western stock of Steller sea
lions (located west of 144°W) decreased from approximately 240,000
animals in the late 1970s to 50,000 in 2000 ({\textbf{???}}). Similarly,
harbor seal populations in Prince William Sound and Glacier Bay declined
by approximately 60\% between the 1980s and 2000 ({\textbf{???}},
{\textbf{???}}). In contrast, the eastern stock of Steller sea lions
(located east of 144°W) increased by 3-4\% per year over the same time
period (Figure 2) ({\textbf{???}}, {\textbf{???}}). More recently,
atmospheric circulation anomalies in the northeast Pacific Ocean have
resulted in unprecedently warm sea surface temperatures during the past
decade ({\textbf{???}}) and this environmental shift has altered fish
abundances ({\textbf{???}}; Litzow et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Litzow2020}{2020}). For example, the
unprecedented marine heatwave that occurred in 2014 - 2016 triggered
dramatic ecosystem change, including a 71\% decline in Pacific cod in
the Gulf of Alaska ({\textbf{???}}). Declines in phytoplankton biomass,
forage fish abundance, and changes in community structure as a whole
were also observed ({\textbf{???}}). During this recent period of
environmental change, many pinniped populations have experienced
increases or stabilization of population abundance ({\textbf{???}})
(Figure 2), although declines in some Gulf of Alaska Steller sea lion
populations were observed following the marine heat wave
({\textbf{???}}).

These variable changes in Alaskan pinniped populations over the past 50
years cannot be attributed to a single cause, as multiple environmental,
anthropogenic, and ecological factors have changed simultaneously. For
example, the rapid decline of the western stock of Steller sea lions
between the 1970s and 1990s has been attributed to myriad factors,
including change to the physical environment, competition with fisheries
for common prey, predation, disease, and human-caused mortality
({\textbf{???}}). Glacier Bay harbor seal populations have primarily,
but not exclusively, been impacted by the decline of sea ice, which
provides a majority of their haulout sites ({\textbf{???}}). Population
declines have also been associated with increased numbers of tour
vessels, particularly in glacier fjords that provide important nursing
and whelping habitat ({\textbf{???}}, {\textbf{???}}). The differences
in pinniped population trends across the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea
suggest varied environmental and ecological drivers underlying these
dynamics. Interestingly, harbor seals and Steller sea lions that occur
in the same geographic region (sympatric) have experienced different
population trends over similar time period (Figure 2). Identifying
trophic position trends through time that are shared, compared to
changes that only impact a specific species or region, can elucidate how
widescale ecological forcing versus localized change influence top
predators and potentially explain variable population abundance trends.

Both harbor seals and Steller sea lions exhibit generalist, piscivorous
foraging strategies, although differences in foraging range, body size,
and diet exist. Adult harbor seals have high site fidelity,
opportunistically forage 5 - 10 km from haulout sites and at depths
\textless{} 200 m ({\textbf{???}}; Lance et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lance2012}{2012}), and weigh up to 300 pounds.
Steller sea lions are central place foragers known to migrate to prey
aggregations on the continental shelf and oceanographic boundary zones
({\textbf{???}}, {\textbf{???}}). Foraging trips can last 1-3 days
({\textbf{???}}) with average distances of 133 km for adult females
({\textbf{???}}), although foraging trips are shorter in the breeding
season ({\textbf{???}}). Adult females can weigh up to 800 pounds
whereas adult males can exceed 2,500 pounds, indicating a higher
energetic demand compared to harbor seals. Diet studies of Steller sea
lions and harbor seals are spatially and temporally limited, and
primarily utilize scat samples. In the Gulf of Alaska, gadids,
cephalopods, and forage fishes are prevalent in both harbor seal and
Steller sea lion diet ({\textbf{???}}, {\textbf{???}}), whereas
salmonids are also important for harbors seals in Bristol Bay and
Iliamna lake ({\textbf{???}}).

Stable isotopes have been used to reconstruct historical differences in
diet and trophic position in Alaskan pinnipeds ({\textbf{???}},
{\textbf{???}}, {\textbf{???}}). These previous studies utilized bulk
stable isotope analysis exclusively and were therefore limited in their
inferential strength. Differences in the bulk
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N of consumer tissues can
indicate either a trophic level change of the consumer or a change in
nitrogen resources at the base of the food web. The specific cause of
the isotopic variation cannot be ascertained from consumer bulk stable
isotope values unless the data are paired with temporal information on
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N in primary producers. Lack
of consistent, concurrent sampling of nitrogen stable isotope
composition of primary producers therefore presents a challenge for
previous long-term studies of the trophic dynamics of consumers from
bulk stable isotope data. CSIA data address this challenge, as amino
acids exhibit two distinct patterns in isotopic enrichment: trophic
amino acids (i.e., glutamic acid, alanine, proline) become enriched in
\textsuperscript{15}N with each trophic transfer and source amino acids
(i.e., phenylalanine) show minimal change and thus are reflective of the
base of the food web (Chikaraishi et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chikaraishi2009}{2009}; McClelland \& Montoya,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-McClelland2002}{2002}; N. Ohkouchi et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ohkouchi2017}{2017}). With the ability to
internally correct for expected changes in
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N at the base of the food web
({\textbf{???}}, {\textbf{???}}), CSIA allows for a more robust
retrospective analysis of consumer trophic dynamics on decadal and
century scales.

The objective of this work is to describe and compare changes in trophic
ecology for Alaskan pinnipeds throughout the past century and
investigate trophic position differences for sympatric populations. We
apply hierarchical Bayesian analyses to 70 years of trophic position
data derived from CSIA from pinnipeds (harbor seal and Steller sea lion)
in the Gulf of Alaska, Bristol Bay, and a small population of freshwater
harbor seals in Iliamna Lake, Alaska which is adjacent to Bristol Bay.
We build on previous research examining pinniped nitrogen stable isotope
composition ({\textbf{???}}, {\textbf{???}}, {\textbf{???}}; Misarti et
al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Misarti2009}{2009}) by adding two decades of
data to the record (2000s and 2010s) and incorporating a broad spatial
scope (Bristol Bay, Iliamna Lake, Gulf of Alaska). Additionally, by
analyzing nitrogen stable isotopes derived from amino acids, we were
able to control for known changes in nitrogen resources and
phytoplankton composition at the base of the food web that can confound
trophic position interpretations from bulk stable isotope data collected
over decadal scales ({\textbf{???}}). Furthermore, by comparing trophic
position dynamics across species and region through time, regional and
location-specific ecological responses to a changing ecosystem can be
identified.

\section{Methods}\label{methods-2}

\subsection{Sample collection and
analysis}\label{sample-collection-and-analysis-1}

Samples were obtained using methods described in ({\textbf{???}}).
Briefly, harbor seal and Steller sea lion bones were sampled from
specimens curated at the University of Alaska Museum of the North
(Supplementary Information Table S1). Specimens were treated by
maceration in warm water and soaked in a dilute ammonia solution then
stored in acid free boxes. Adult specimens were sampled exclusively to
avoid dietary differences between adults and juveniles. Specimens were
classified based on species and region. We prioritized long-term
temporal coverage in four regional classifications of harbor seals
(Iliamna Lake, southeast Gulf of Alaska, northern Gulf of Alaska,
eastern Bering Sea) and two regional classifications of Steller sea
lions (eastern and western stocks) for a total of 6 species x region
classifications. Specimens were extremely limited for the eastern
Steller sea lion stock (n = 2) and Iliamna Lake harbor seas (n = 3). We
also prioritized specimens with sex and age identifications, but these
data were not available for some specimens. A total of 106 harbor seal
and 21 Steller sea lion specimens were sampled representing the 1950s to
2010s (Figure 1).

Steller sea lions were classified according to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) distinct population segments, where
Steller sea lions east of 144°W are considered the eastern stock and
west of 144°W are considered the western stock (Figure 1). NOAA has
identified twelve stocks of harbor seals in Alaska and, due to
limitations of archived specimens, harbor seals were not able to be
classified according to NOAA stocks. Instead, they were classified based
on their range relative to the Steller sea lion stocks and utilization
of marine versus freshwater habitats. Harbor seals that were west of
144°W, which included samples from the Prince William Sound and Cook
Inlet/Shelikof Strait stocks (Figure 1), were classified as northern
Gulf of Alaska harbor seals. Harbor seals that were located east of
144°W, which included samples from the Glacier Bay/Icy Strait,
Sitka/Chatham Strait, Lynn Canal/Stephens Passage, Dixon/Capes
Decisions, and Clarence Strait stocks (Figure 1), were classified as
southeast Gulf of Alaska harbor seals. The Bristol Bay harbor seal stock
was divided into two classifications, Bristol Bay referring to marine
harbor seals, and Iliamna Lake referring to freshwater harbor seals
(Figure 1). This allowed for comparison of three pairs of geographically
overlapping classifications: western stock of Steller sea lions and
northern Gulf of Alaska harbors seals, eastern stock of Steller sea
lions and southeast Gulf of Alaska harbor seals, and Bristol Bay and
Iliamna Lake harbor seals.

\subsection{Trophic position
calculation}\label{trophic-position-calculation}

Bone collagen within the samples was decalcified, acid hydrolyzed,
derivatized and analyzed for compound-specific stable isotope analysis
(CSIA) of nitrogen (\(\delta^{15}N\)) for 12 individual amino acids
following the protocol described in ({\textbf{???}}). \(\delta^{15}N\)
was measured as:
\begin{equation} 
  \delta^{15}N ( \textperthousand vs. air) =   
  [(\frac{^{15}N/^{14}N_{Sample}}{^{15}N/^{14}N_{Air}} -1)*1000]
  \label{eq:deltN2}
\end{equation}
Collagen samples were measured in triplicate with a laboratory standard
containing a 12 amino acid mixture of known isotopic composition. Full
analytical details are described in Appendix S1.

Trophic position was calculated using a harbor seal-specific trophic
discrimination factor (difference in
\textsuperscript{15}N/\textsuperscript{14}N between trophic and source
amino acids in consumers for a trophic transfer; Germain et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Germain2013}{2013})). This approach assumed
trophic discrimination factors (TDF) derived from controlled feeding
studies of harbor seals were similar to Steller sea lions. Applying a
``multi-TDF'' approach that combines both average and taxa-specific TDF
can improve trophic position estimates in marine predators including
pinnipeds (Germain et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Germain2013}{2013};
McMahon et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-McMahon2019}{2019}). The
following equation was used to determine the trophic position of each
sampled individual:
\begin{equation} 
Trophic Position =   
  \frac{\delta^{15}N_i - \delta^{15}N_o - TDF_{(i-o),j} - \overline{\beta}_{(i-o)}}{\overline{TDF}_{(i-o)}}+2
  \label{eq:TP}
\end{equation}
where, \(\delta^{15}N_i\) is the measured stable isotope composition of
a trophic amino acid i in a sample and \(\delta^{15}N_o\) is the stable
isotope composition of a source amino acid o in a sample.
\(\overline{TDF}_{(i-o)}\) is the mean difference between given trophic
amino acid \emph{i} and source amino acid \emph{o} across all consumers
described in ({\textbf{???}}). \(TDF_{(i-o), j}\) is the trophic
discrimination factor between trophic amino acid \emph{i} and source
amino acid \emph{o} from a controlled feeding study of a specific
consumer \emph{j}; here we use harbor seals from Germain et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Germain2013}{2013}) (Table 1).
\(\overline\beta_{(i-o)}\) is the mean difference in \(\delta^{15}N\)
across aquatic phytoplankton between a specific trophic amino acid
\emph{i} and source amino acid \emph{o} {[}({\textbf{???}}); Table 1{]}.
({\textbf{???}}) also determined using multiple amino acids to estimate
trophic position improves precision. Therefore, we used multiple trophic
amino acids \emph{i} (alanine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and proline)
and one source amino acid \emph{o} (phenyalanine) to calculate trophic
position (Table 1). These amino acids were chosen based on their
prevalence in previous studies to derive parameters for equation 2, and
their concentrations in bone collagen (see Appendix S1).

\subsection{Model framework}\label{model-framework}

Sex was considered as a predictor for trophic position, however, sex
metadata were not available for all specimens. In order to evaluate
difference in trophic position by sex, we fit linear statistical models
to each individual trophic amino acid, by classification (species x
region). These models took the following form:
\begin{equation} 
y_i = \alpha + \boldsymbol\beta x_i + \epsilon_i, \epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma)
  \label{eq:linsex}
\end{equation}
where, \(y_i\) is trophic position for an individual amino acid and
\(\boldsymbol\beta\) is a vector of coefficients for the predictor, in
this case sex, and \(\epsilon\) are residual errors assumed to be
normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation \(\sigma\).
There was not sufficient metadata for the eastern stock Steller sea lion
population or the Iliamna Lake population and these two classifications
were omitted from this analysis.

A Bayesian hierarchical mixed effects model was used to identify decadal
change across pinniped classifications (species x region), and the
degree to which these changes were shared by testing the effects of
classification, decade, and a classification-decade interaction as
either population-level (fixed) or group-level (random) effects (see
candidate models in Table 2). Hierarchical models share information
across `groups' to identify common responses, which refers to both
decade and classification in this study. The interaction term allows for
increased flexibility, letting each classification have slight
departures from the group-level means. The mean and variance of pinniped
trophic position for each region-species classification and decade were
estimated using a generalized linear Bayesian hierarchical model with
decade, population, and trophic amino acid as predictors:
\begin{equation} 
y_i = \boldsymbol\alpha + \boldsymbol\beta x_i + \epsilon_i, \epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma_y)
  \label{eq:linsex}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
\boldsymbol\alpha_{k=1:k} \sim N(\mu_{\alpha,k},\sigma_{\alpha,k})
  \label{eq:linsex}
\end{equation}
where, for data point \emph{i}, \(\boldsymbol\beta\) is a vector of
coefficients for the unpooled predictors (fixed effects, Table 2) and
\(\boldsymbol\alpha\) is a vector of coefficients for the partially
pooled group-level predictors (random effects, Table 2) for group
\emph{k} (amino acid, decade or classification). At minimum, the
\(\boldsymbol\alpha\) included a random term for the amino acid
corresponding to data point \emph{i}, and depending on the model
included up to a total of 4 random effects (also effects of decade,
classification, and their interaction, Model 6 in Table 2). For each
random effect included, \(\mu_{α,k}\) and \(\sigma_{α,k}\) are
hyperparameters representing the mean and standard deviation of
group-level effects on trophic position, for random effect \emph{k}. For
models with more than one random effect, we assumed the deviations to be
independent and uncorrelated. We considered models that included decade,
classification, and the interaction between decade and classification
either as fixed or random effects (e.g.~Model 4 v Model 6, Table 2), but
did not consider models that included both as fixed and random (Table
2). Parameter estimates were obtained using the brms package
(({\textbf{???}}), version 2.14.4) in R (R Core Development Team 2021,
version 3.6.2), which implements a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler and
its extension no-U-turn sampler ({\textbf{???}}) through Stan (Stan
Development Team 2020). Minimally informative priors were used for
random effects (normal distributions with a mean of 0 and variance of
10) and fixed effects (Student's t-distribution with a mean of 0,
standard deviation of 2.5 and 3 degrees of freedom). Trophic amino acid
was included as a random effect for all models (Table 2). Selection of
the best models (Table 2) given the data was based on approximate
leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOIC) using the loo package
(({\textbf{???}}), version 2.4.1).

\section{Results}\label{results-2}

We found no differences between the average male and female pinniped
trophic position over the 50-year study period (Figure 3) for the four
tested species-region classifications. This finding was consistent for
all trophic amino acids-source amino acid pairs (Figure 3). Based on
glutamic acid trophic position estimates, both western stock Steller sea
lions (2.6 ± 0.5; mean ± sd) and eastern stock Steller sea lions (2.7 ±
0.16) had similar trophic positions. Harbor seals in the Gulf of Alaska
foraged higher in the food web than their Steller sea lion counterparts
(Figure 3). Harbor seals in the southeast region had a higher trophic
position on average than any other pinniped in this study (3.5 ± 0.3)
but were similar to harbor seals in the northern region (3.3 ± 0.5).
Bristol Bay (3.1 ± 0.4) and Iliamna lake (3.0 ± 0.3) harbor seals had a
lower trophic position than their Gulf of Alaska counterparts on average
(Figure 3).

\subsection{Common trends in Alaskan pinniped trophic
position}\label{common-trends-in-alaskan-pinniped-trophic-position}

The best performing model (Table 2, model 6) of pinniped trophic
position included both species-region classification and decade as
random effects (shared trends) along with an interaction between
population and decade (Table 2). Based on the support for decade and
classification to be included as group-level effects, these data support
consistent differences between classifications over time, as well as
differences between trophic position for all classifications. The
supported interaction between population and decade (Table 2) indicates
distinct decadal changes in trophic position for species-region
classifications exist. The model that included decade, classification,
and the interaction between decade and classification as fixed effects
(model 4) was also supported based on the models LOOIC (Table 2).
Therefore, the inclusion of the interaction term was more important for
improving model performance than inclusion of decade and classification
as fixed versus random effects.

There were consistent differences in trophic position that varied by
species and ocean basin for the model with the most support. Harbor
seals in the Gulf of Alaska had higher trophic position than their
Steller sea lion counterparts. The mean difference of the posterior
distributions indicated southeast Gulf of Alaska harbor seals have
historically fed at 0.32 {[}-0.01, 0.61{]} (highest density 80\%
credible interval) trophic levels higher than sympatric eastern stock
Steller sea lions (Figure 4). Similarly, the mean difference of
posterior distributions showed northern Gulf of Alaska harbor seals fed
0.28 {[}-0.03, 0.50{]} trophic levels higher than the sympatric western
stock Steller sea lions. Within the Gulf of Alaska, the posterior
distributions for trophic position overlapped 39\% between harbor seals
and Steller sea lions in both the eastern and western regions (Figure
4). Iliamna Lake harbor seals have historically fed at a lower trophic
level (mean posterior difference 0.16 {[}-0.11, 0.41{]}) than harbor
seals in Bristol Bay, but these two classifications have 66\% overlap of
the group-level posterior distributions for trophic position (Figure 4).
The 80\% credible intervals included 0 for most region-species
classifications thus the posterior probabilities support marginal
evidence for consistent differences in trophic position between
classifications. Regardless, the differences in posterior means were
large, although the distributions were wide.

There were no consistent decadal differences in trophic position across
the region-species classification (Figure 5). Pinniped trophic position
in the 2000s was slightly higher for all classifications (mean posterior
difference 0.03 {[}-0.09, 0.16{]}) on average compared to 1990 and the
posterior distributions for 1990 and 2000 had an 85\% overlap (Figure
5). Similarly, posterior distributions in between 2000 and 2010 had a
mean difference of -0.1 {[}-0.27, 0.08{]} with a 65\% overlap (Figure
4). Overall, decadal differences in pinniped trophic position through
time were smaller than the region-species classification effects and
were likely ecologically inconsequential.

\subsection{Spatial and temporal differences in pinniped trophic
structure}\label{spatial-and-temporal-differences-in-pinniped-trophic-structure}

Distinct decadal changes in trophic position were observed for each
species-region classification and varied more than the shared decadal
changes (Figure 6) as indicated by the decade-classification
interaction. Most, but not all, pinniped classifications experienced
substantial trophic level change in 2000 or 2010 but the magnitude and
direction of this change varied by region-species classification based
on the combined effects of decade, classification, and the
decade-classification interaction (Figure 6). The recent decadal change
in trophic position was most prominent for the western stock of Steller
sea lions which had a mean trophic level decrease of 0.43 {[}-0.25,
-0.60{]} from 1990 to 2000 (a percent decrease of 0.15) with only a 21\%
overlap between the posterior distributions (Figure 6E). This decline in
trophic position remained in the 2010s. A similar decline was observed
in the southeast Gulf of Alaska harbor seals. This population
experienced relatively stable trophic position from 1960-1990, which
then declined on average by 0.31 {[}-0.19, -0.45{]} trophic levels in
2000 (33\% posterior overlap) (Figure 6C). In contrast, harbor seals in
the northern Gulf of Alaska had variable trophic position across decades
and had the highest trophic position in 2000 in contrast to their
southeast Gulf of Alaska harbor seals and Steller sea lion counterparts
(Figure 6B). Data were only available for 2000 and 2010 for the eastern
stock Steller sea lions, and trophic position was similar for this
population during both of these decades (Figure 6F). Both Bristol Bay
and Iliamna Lake harbor seals had relatively stable trophic position
from 1950s until 2010s (Figure 6A \& B). Bristol Bay harbor seals
experienced their lowest trophic level in the 1990s with a 0.24
{[}-0.54, 0.00{]} trophic level decrease compared to the 1970s and
2000s, but the posterior distribution still overlapped 54\% with other
decades (Figure 6A).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion-2}

Over the past 70 years, Alaskan pinnipeds have exhibited both common and
distinct differences in trophic position across region-species
classification on decadal scales (Table 2). While potential drivers of
change in trophic position were not tested in this study due to data
limitations, our results support a combination of local-scale (i.e.,
vessel traffic, reduction of glacial ice, local foraging) and
regional-scale (i.e., environmental condition, basin-wide prey
abundance) changes may be influencing pinniped trophic ecology.
Furthermore, the largest decadal changes in pinniped trophic position
were distinct for each region-species classification and were most
apparent during the most recent two decades (2000s and 2010s). These
patterns are more pronounced in the Gulf of Alaska compared to Bristol
Bay (Figures 5 \& 6).

\subsection{Regional and species trends in harbor seal trophic
position}\label{regional-and-species-trends-in-harbor-seal-trophic-position}

Both Steller sea lions and harbor seals exhibit generalist foraging
patterns ({\textbf{???}}; Lance et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lance2012}{2012}). Diets of Alaskan pinnipeds
consist of similar prey species but vary between species, population,
and local availability of prey ({\textbf{???}}, {\textbf{???}}). Bulk
stable isotope studies in the Gulf of Alaska have shown that Steller sea
lions feed lower in the food web compared to harbor seals
({\textbf{???}}). Our CSIA analysis confirms the interpretation of these
previous studies that isotopic differences can be attributed to trophic
position changes and not isotopic shift of basal phytoplankton
resources. Both western and eastern stock Steller sea lions have lower
trophic position compared to sympatric harbor seal populations but have
similar trophic position compared to other populations such as Iliamna
Lake. However, despite known differences in both diet ({\textbf{???}},
{\textbf{???}}) and nearshore versus offshore foraging ({\textbf{???}},
{\textbf{???}}) between the two species, our results also show
historical overlap in trophic position, indicating potential trophic
redundancy between harbor seals and Steller sea lions in the Gulf of
Alaska.

Harbor seals in Bristol Bay and Iliamna Lake are managed as a single
population ({\textbf{???}}) despite lack of evidence of migration by the
freshwater population and utilization of different resources
({\textbf{???}}). A previous study of strontium and carbon stable
isotopes showed Iliamna Lake harbor seals utilize freshwater-derived
resources (resident lake fishes), particularly early in life, and
exhibit an ontogenetic shift to more marine resources (returning sockeye
salmon) later in life ({\textbf{???}}). Based on CSIA nitrogen data,
Iliamna Lake harbor seals also forage lower in the food web compared to
Bristol Bay harbor seals. In addition, both classifications exhibited
trophic stability, with the Bristol Bay harbor seals only experiencing a
trophic shift in the 1990s relative to the 1960s and 1970s. This
coincided with the lowest sockeye salmon returns to Iliamna Lake on
record ({\textbf{???}}). Interestingly, the decrease in trophic position
in the 1990s occurred simultaneously with decreases in basin wide
Bristol Bay harbor seal abundance in the late 1990s, which then
stabilized and increased in the 2000s and 2010s (Figure 2). Data were
not available for the freshwater harbor seals between 1990 and 2000 and
thus it is unclear whether the freshwater population also experienced a
trophic position change during the 1990s when sockeye salmon returns
were low. While quantitative comparisons to salmon abundance were not
made in this study, salmon population abundance and harbor seal trophic
ecology and population trends are seemingly interrelated.

\subsection{Recent trophic position changes in the Gulf of
Alaska}\label{recent-trophic-position-changes-in-the-gulf-of-alaska}

Trophic position changes were observed in all pinniped classifications
in the Gulf of Alaska during the past two decades, although the
direction of these changes varied on more local scales. During the past
two decades (2000-2020), harbor seals in the Gulf of Alaska have
experienced stabilization of most monitored populations following
long-term declines that persisted from the 1950s through the 1990s
(Figure 2, ({\textbf{???}})). During this same time period, harbor seals
in both southeast and northern Gulf of Alaska experienced a shift in
trophic position that was particularly prominent in the 2000s compared
to historic estimates of trophic position (Figure 6B \& C). It is
possible that the observed trophic position shift may have contributed
to the population stabilization of Gulf of Alaska harbor seals, either
by an increase in prey availability or opportunistically foraging on a
novel prey source. ({\textbf{???}}) observed similar trophic position
declines in seabird populations, which were attributed to a shift in
diet from fish to squid. A similar dietary shift could explain the
observed trophic position shift in southeast Gulf of Alaska harbor seals
and western stock Steller sea lions.

Recent regional change in the Gulf of Alaskan food webs has been well
documented in other species and primarily attributed to bottom-up
effects of climate ({\textbf{???}}; Litzow et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Litzow2020}{2020}). These region-wide trends
likely altered prey availability for pinniped populations in the Gulf of
Alaska. How pinniped populations have adapted their foraging ecology,
however, indicates regional and species trophic divergence, which could
be attributed to either local-scale foraging adaptations or differences
in prey availability. Pinniped groups that overlap in space (Figure 1)
revealed divergent trends in trophic position between Steller sea lions
and harbor seals in recent decades (Figure 6B \& E). For example,
trophic position of northern Gulf of Alaska harbor seals increased in
the 2000s while the western stock of Steller sea lions decreased. For
western stock Steller sea lions, this shift also persisted into the
2010s (Figure 6E). Posterior distributions of western stock Steller sea
lions and northern Gulf of Alaska harbor seals overlapped by 63\% in the
1950s but only overlapped by 3\% in the 2000s (Figure 6B \& E). The
recent change in pinniped trophic position within the Gulf of Alaska
coincided with population abundance stabilization, albeit at lower than
historical abundance for most populations. This trophic divergence
indicates there could be increased competition for resources between
northern Gulf of Alaska harbor seals and western stock Steller sea lions
resulting in diet adaptations. Similar comparisons were challenging to
make for the eastern stock of Steller sea lions and southeast Gulf of
Alaska harbor seals due to limitations in historical data for the
former. However, trophic position in the 2000s showed a 38\% overlap
(Figure 6C \& E) between the two species, indicating any trophic
divergence between them may be less pronounced in this region, if
existent.

The observed divergent trends indicate differences in how Alaskan
pinnipeds are adapting to environmental and ecological changes. Trophic
position changes from stable isotope data can be accounted for by: 1)
prey switching between different species, 2) consuming different sizes
of the same prey, or 3) consuming different quality prey. These changes
can occur at the consumer level (pinnipeds) or lower in the food web and
still be reflected in consumer stable isotope signature and thus trophic
position. In recent decades, Pacific salmon and halibut in Alaska have
both declined in size ({\textbf{???}}, {\textbf{???}}). These changes in
size distributions of prey have been attributed to changes in marine
mammal populations (Groskreutz et al. 2019) and likely contributed to
the observed trophic position declines in western Steller sea lion and
southeast Gulf of Alaska harbor seals. In contrast, consuming
low-quality prey with lower protein content and greater amino acid
imbalance between consumer and prey increases the amino acid trophic
enrichment factor of nitrogen ({\textbf{???}}). If not accounted for in
trophic position equations, this increase in trophic enrichment factor
can result in erroneously high trophic position estimates. This may
explain the observed increase in estimated trophic position in northern
Gulf of Alaska harbor seals where this population may be consuming a
greater proportion of lower quality prey (i.e., crustaceans, shrimp,
cephalopods) in recent decades rather than feeding on prey species that
are higher in the food web.

\subsection{Considerations and limitations for CSIA
analyses}\label{considerations-and-limitations-for-csia-analyses}

The data in this study were limited in sample size primarily due to the
availability of archived specimens. As a result, we were not able to
discern between known fine scale differences in populations or annual
trends. For example, harbor seals in the southeast Gulf of Alaska
consist of 13 individual stocks. Due to limitations in the number of
archived specimens, these stocks were pooled and analyzed as a single
classification despite known differences in genetic structure
({\textbf{???}}). Given the observed broad range in trophic position of
these generalist predators, it is unlikely that inclusion of finer
spatial dynamics would have changed the supported model, although
variation in temporal trends within a classification may have been
identified. Similarly, data were only available for eastern stock
Steller sea lions for 2000s and 2010s. As a result, no historical
comparisons were possible and the conclusions about this population are
tentative. Nonetheless, this dataset offers historic documentation of
pinniped trophic position that can be updated with future samples or
additional archived specimens.

Trophic position estimates in this study were low compared to known
foraging strategies of these pinnipeds. For example, Steller sea lions
eat primarily walleye pollock and Atka mackerel ({\textbf{???}},
{\textbf{???}}), which would indicate a trophic position of 3 or higher.
Mean trophic position for Steller sea lions was closer to 2.7 in this
study, which is lower than expected based on known foraging ecology. It
is common for CSIA to underestimate trophic position of marine predators
(Germain et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Germain2013}{2013}; McMahon et
al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-McMahon2019}{2019}) and the inclusion of
multiple amino acid pairs and a multi-trophic enrichment factor
framework did not fully resolve this issue. ({\textbf{???}}) found
trophic position estimates can be highly sensitive to the applied
\(\beta\) values in equation 2. In our trophic position calculation, we
assumed a constant \(\beta\) represented by marine diatoms. However,
\(\beta\) values differ by more than 11 per mille between seagrasses and
diatoms ({\textbf{???}}) which has been attributed to differences
between vascular and nonvascular plants ({\textbf{???}},
({\textbf{???}})). If vascular plants, such as seagrasses, contribute to
the food web in addition to non-vascular algae, the applied β would be
too high and would result in underestimation of trophic position of
marine consumers ({\textbf{???}}, ({\textbf{???}})). Even a 10\%
contribution of vascular plant-derived nitrogen to the food web would
result in an underestimation of 0.2 trophic position. It is likely that
vascular plants at least partially contribute to the Alaskan food web,
as seagrass beds provide essential habitat and food for many fish
species and invertebrates. Consideration for variable \(\beta\) values
may be helpful in resolving trophic position underestimation of future
studies, especially in cases where consumer carbon stable isotope data
is available and contributions of seagrasses to the food web are well
documented.

\subsection{Conclusions and
Implications}\label{conclusions-and-implications}

Marine ecosystems in Alaska are experiencing unprecedented environmental
change that has altered abundance and size distributions of many fish
species consumed by pinnipeds ({\textbf{???}}, {\textbf{???}},
{\textbf{???}}, {\textbf{???}}). Heterogeneity in diet and foraging
locations allow top predators to adjust to availability of resources by
altering their foraging. Based on the observed region-species specific
changes in trophic position over the past two decades, pinnipeds are
experiencing different food web conditions than in the past, even those
that occur in similar geographic regions. This may be the result of
adapting foraging strategies to exploit other prey resources or a change
that is occurring lower in the food web and is measurable in predators.
While our results cannot discern between these two mechanisms of trophic
level change, we can conclude that recent food web dynamics have
impacted pinniped trophic ecology in Alaska. Future responses of
pinnipeds to food web change will likely be locally variable between
species, even those that occur within similar geographic regions.

\section{Full analytical details for bulk stable
isotopes}\label{full-analytical-details-for-bulk-stable-isotopes}

Collagen samples have been analyzed for both CSSIA and bulk
\(\delta^{15}N\) which require 10 mg of purified collagen (100 mg of
bone). Preliminary analyses were conducted to determine the highest rate
of collagen return from bone sampled from different parts of the skull
to minimize destruction. Samples were taken from the internal occipital
shelf to maintain external integrity. Bone was decalcified using 0.2 M
HCl for 24-72 hours depending on bone thickness, followed by
centrifugation and nanopure water rinse. Removal of humic acids was
conducted using 0.125 M NaOH for 20 hours. Samples were washed to a
neutral pH, then solubilized in 0.01N HCl. Once solubilized samples were
blown down under N2 to prevent isotopic fractionation, and freeze dried.
Freeze dried collagen was be analyzed for bulk isotopic composition of
nitrogen by the UW IsoLab (isolab.ess.washington.edu) using a coupled
elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometer following the
standard protocols of the laboratory. C:N ratios were calculated from
this data, which is a measure of the quality for carbon and nitrogen
analyses of bone collagen for isotopic analysis. Only three observations
were outside of the acceptable rang of 2.7-3.6; indicating there was no
substantial loss of glycine or addition of nitrogen due to microbial
processing from mortality, decay, curation, and analysis.

\(\delta^{15}N\) of eleven amino acids were measured in the UW Facility
for Compound-Specific Isotope Analysis of Environmental Samples. Samples
were prepared following the procedures developed by Popp Marine Lab at
University of Hawaii Manoa. Briefly, proteins were hydrolyzed in 6N HCl
and purified using a cation exchange column. Amino acids were esterified
using isopropanol acetyl chloride, and derivatized via acylation with
4:1 toluene: pivaloyl chloride. Samples were brought up in ethyl acetate
and analyzed using a coupled gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio
mass spectrometer system (GC-C-irMA; Thermo Scientific Trace GC + GC
IsoLink coupled to a Delta V irMS) in continuous flow mode monitoring
masses (m/z) 28 and 29 using a db-35 column. For each run a 12 amino
acid external standard with known isotopic composition was injected
three times followed by sample injections. Samples were injected in
triplicate, with the 12 amino acid standard injected every two samples
(or six injections). A two-hour column oxidation was performed after 6
samples (25 injections). Samples and standards included norleucine as an
internal standard.

For each machine run, a linear model was fit for each individual amino
acid using the following equation:
\begin{equation} 
  Std_{aa} = m_{aa}t + b_{aa}
  \label{eq:std}
\end{equation}
Where m represents the slope of the precision drift, \emph{t} represents
the injection number since last column oxidation, and \emph{Std}
represents the \(\delta^{15}N\) of an individual amino acid for a
standard observation. The data was then corrected using the following
equations:
\begin{equation} 
  D_{aa, t} = Std_{aa,t} - True
  \label{eq:diff}
\end{equation}
Where \(D_{aa,t}\) is the difference between an observed standard
\(\delta^{15}N\) of \(Std_{aa,t}\) for a given amino acid at a given
injection number and the true \(\delta^{15}N\) for that standard. Then:
\begin{equation} 
  Sample_{corrected,aa,t} = Sample_{obs,aa,t} - D_{aa,t}
  \label{eq:sampcorr}
\end{equation}
Where the drift value, \(D_{aa,t}\), is subtracted from the sample value
for a given amino acid and a given injection to correct the observed
sample values for precision drift since last column oxidation. Mean
sample corrected values for the triplicate injections were used for all
amino acid \(\delta^{15}N\).
