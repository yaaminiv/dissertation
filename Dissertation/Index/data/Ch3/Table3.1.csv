Downey-Wall et al. 2020,Crassostrea virginica,Ocean acidification,80 days,Mantle,MBDBS,NR,%meth lower in OA treatment,85 DML (38 / 47),DML predominantly in gene regions,Aminotransferase complex and biosynthetic process GOterms were enriched in hypomethylated DML,Weak but statistically significant relatinoship between DNA methylation and gene expression (RNA-Seq)
Venkataraman et al. 2020,Crassostrea virginica,Ocean acidification,4 weeks,Gonad,MBDBS,22%,None,598 DML (310 / 288),"Majority of DML were in exons, followed by introns",None,NR
Chandra Rajan et al. 2021,Crassostrea hongkongensis,Ocean acidification,4.5 months,Mantle,MethylRAD,NR,NR,377 DMG (214 / 163),"Loci used to identify differentially methylated genes were primarily in introns, followed by exons, intergenic regions, splice donor sites, downstream regions, and upstream regions","Top molecular function GOterms enriched in hypomethylated genes were acetoacetylco-A reductase activity and types of dehydrogenase activity, and biological process terms included cellular response to pH. Top molecular function GOterms enriched in hypermethylated genes were protein xylosyltransferase activity, translation factor activity, RNA binding, diacylglycerol kinase activity.",No direct methylation regulation of gene expression (RNA-Seq)
Lim et al. 2020,Crassostrea hongkongensis,Ocean acidification,21 days,Pediveliger larvae,MethylRAD,NR,NR,130 DMG (66 / 64),Loci used to identify differentially methylated genes were concentrated in exons (78.5% of loci),"Enriched processes of DMG were associated with cytoskeletal and signal transduction, oxidative stress, metabolic processes, and larval metamorphosis",NR

Johnson et al. 2020,Crassostrea virginica,Perkinsus marinus infection,14 months,Gill,epiGBS/RRBS,NR,NR,913 DMR (NR),"78.8% of DMR found in gene bodies, followed by promoters and downstream regions",None,"Near-significant association of increased expression (TagSeq) and promoter methylation, significant interaction between expression and gene body methylation, and no interaction between expression and downstream methylation. Significant relationship between decreasing methylation and increasing gene expression variation. Only 2 DMR and 2 DEG overlapped and there was no significant connection between methylation and expression for those overlaps."
Rondon et al. 2017,Crassostrea gigas,Diuron ,2 7-day periods,Spat of adult oysters exposed to diuron,WGBS,16.60%,None,236 DMR (121 / 115),"Majority of DMR (73.2%) found in genes, with 38.2% in exons and 34.8% in introns. Genic DMR were generally found at the end of coding sequences, with 36.5% of exon-specific DMR were found in the last exon of genes, and 25.5% of intron-specific DMR were found in the last introns of genes",NR,"DNA methylatoin changes correlated directly with RNA abundance (RNA-Seq) in a small group of highly methylated genes, but did not systematically lead to splice variants (based on qPCR)"
