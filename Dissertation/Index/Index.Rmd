# Introduction {.unnumbered}

- The enviornment is changing
-In order to understand how the environment is changing, we need data from the past
-Historical data for species abundance is usually avaialble and how the environment is changing species abundance is well documented across ecosystems globally
-Abundance is not the only important ecosystem component, we know species interactions are just as important for shaping and influencing ecosystems
-But historical indices of ecosystem interactions are rare and can be challenging to reproduce for modern datasets.
-Chemical tracers can be a useful tool for measuring ecological interactions especially on long timescales.
Here we use CSSIA of amino acids and inorganic nitrogen to assess changes in species interactions in teperate marine and riparian ecosystems.
<!--  If you're still on the fence about using _R Markdown_, check out the resource for newbies available at <https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/> .  -->

**Why use it?**

_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the beauty of LaTeX.  Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. In addition to creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX, _R Markdown_ also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it and to visualize it using **R** functions, and also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your project.  Further, it allows for **R** results to be passed inline to the commentary of your results.  You'll see more on this later.  

<!--  Having your code and commentary all together in one place has a plethora of benefits! -->

**Who should use it?**

Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures, complex cross-references, or who just cares about the final appearance of their document should use _R Markdown_. Of particular use should be anyone in the sciences, but the user-friendly nature of _Markdown_ and its ability to keep track of and easily include figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index, references, table of figures, etc. should make it of great benefit to nearly anyone writing a thesis project.
